  Title: Chronostianity
  allChapters:
  - chapterName: INTRODUCTIONS
    content: "Chronostianity is a Zenithian system of thought and behavior originated
      in Great Lantorn Desert. The Chronostians worships Kronos as the God who controls
      time & space of the universe. The religion oriented heavily around the concept
      of time and unlike most Safarian religion, Chronostianity is a more of philosophical,
      rationalistic religion & critical thinking rather than promoting the cult of
      personality or a central figure. There was no \u2018inventor\u2019 of the religion,
      the most commonly accepted fact is that the origin of the religion was from
      the Zenith Federation in the 3rd century BC.\r\n\r\nChronostianity is highly
      decentralized religion, it was has its own denomination until merged together
      following Kaiser\u2019s emergence. Chronostianity is a constantly evolving
      teaching meaning the teachings of the Chronostianity is works upon millenias
      of research of one\u2019s perception of time, concept of time and study of
      entropy. The collection of Chronostian teachings collected in a book called
      Timekeeper Testaments.\r\n\r\nOne of the roots of secularism in planet Safar
      originated from Chronostianity, early Chronostianity tested out its theory
      through testable experiment and verify their teachings through empirical evidence.
      The heavy use of experimentation and constantly changing understanding of the
      meaning of time meant Chronostianity is Safar\u2019s precursor of modern science.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'I. BELIEFS '
    content: "Each denomination has widely different beliefs but there are several
      most essential feature is that almost all Chronostians believes:\r\n\r\n-\tKronos
      is the central figure of Chronostianity. This is basically a monotheist religion.
      \r\n-\tThere are three planes of reality, the Fake World, Real World and Time
      World. Fake World is basically like the metaverse or cyberspace created by
      people in the real world. Time World is where God resides.\r\r\n-\tThey believe
      greater plane of reality must exists 100% due to a \u2019glitch in the matrix\u2019.
      This glitch of the matrix is the Warp Gate which are invented by the Elven
      and Titan race around 200k years ago without any clear record in the past and
      the recently discovered the first consistent and verifiable existence of Timekeepers
      which somehow allows people to remembers things after their death.\r\n\r-\tThe
      universe has been intervened by beings that lives on the greater plane of reality.
      The universe supposed working like a simulation (Anima Naturalis; the being
      is natural and contained within that space and time) but the intervention of
      outside forces is similar to someone using a cheat code in video games and
      a change of the simulation.\r\n\r-\tTimekeepers no longer myth after Kaiser
      of Sixtus\u2019 exploitative use of Machine of Madness. Timekeepers are Externum
      Anima; their soul has been lost in time and space.\r\n\r\n\r\nKronos\r\n\r\nKronos
      is described as the God who controls time and space of the universe. Before
      the 20th-century, Reformian Chronos and other branches has agnostic belief
      towards the existence of Kronos, however the discovery of Warp Gate and Kaiser\u2019s
      Machine of Madness led to the total conversion of Kronos unbelievers to become
      believe the existence of God due to the \u2018glitch in the matrix\u2019. \r\n\r\n\r\nDenominations\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore
      the Kaiser of Sixtus\u2019 rise, Chronostianity is divided into several major
      lines: \r\n\r\n-\tReformian Chronos\r\n\r\n-\tOrthodox Chronos\r\n\r\n-\tPragmatics\r\n\r\nThe
      rise of Kaiser of Sixtus led to many existential crises for Chronostianity,
      the Machine of Madness led the total infalsible existential proof of the Timekeepers.
      Pre-Machine of Madness, Timekeeper is ambigious and literally never existed
      in older records. The proofing is impossible, a Timekeeper would certainly
      never committed suicide to proof the existence of time loop cycle hence causing
      many Timekeeper never realizes their potential. However, the Machine of Madness
      can turn back time which effects all Timekeepers.\r\n\r\nThis unprecedented
      phenomenon cause all Timekeepers to instant realization of their ability, hence
      why the Coalition of Timekeepers could only form after Kaiser\u2019s use of
      Machine of Madness.\r\n\r\n\r\nEthics & Social\r\n\r\n\r\nChronostians values
      time above else. Pedis is boredom, to feel \u201CMay a minute felt like an
      hour\u201D, this is regarded as \u201Cgood\u201D. Chronostian argued boredom
      is when creativity flourished and able to think critically better. Wasting
      time or time felt passing fast is called Alos, this is regarded as \u201Cbad\u201D,
      being not bored is a state of ignorance. This is because the brain is constantly
      pre-occupied with the environment without space to relax & think critically.
      Incidentally, this focus on the environment meant Chronostian must thoughtful
      of one\u2019s feeling and thinking. \r\n\r\nOne must not always felt time is
      constantly passing quickly. Without sufficient contemplation of the surrounding
      environment, it will not be able to see the world clearly and had a narrow
      view of the world. Tiranose Kalos, is a phrase that describes a person would
      have a internal unrest due to constantly feeling Alos. Activities that removes
      the feeling of uselessness or time-passing too fast is called Alos Defusal,
      the goal is to move towards Pedis as much as possible. Time passing quickly
      can cause the feeling of unrest particularly the feel of being useless, it
      must be purged by doing something productive. Some Chronostians, may express
      guilt when they felt useless, one that felt he/she is a burden for other people
      would feel a guilty feeling of wasting one\u2019s time. Being unpleasant to
      other people is also considered some form of Alos. Some hardcore Chronostian
      may even isolate themselves as further as possible to prevent becoming a nuisance
      to others. This practice make them highly careful of taking other person\u2019s
      time.\r\n\r\nContemporary behaviour like playing video games, talking stupid
      to other people, ranting in the internet or simply hanging out with friends
      can be undesired for Chronostians, they prefer productive activities like reading
      books, studying, meeting new people for business connection or any productive
      tasks. For artisans, Chronostians feared creating a piece of work that is only
      for \u2018fun\u2019; \u2018fun\u2019 video games or entertainment product is
      unfavorable as they thought it was stealing other people\u2019s time away with
      no productive value. Instead, they prefer to put out a product that is short
      to experience but very meaningful and impactful, in other words if you can
      teach a person how to do calculus in a week rather than a month, it is great
      deed.\r\n\r\nChronostians likened the idea of merging several things into one
      object if the reader or viewers can parse something much more quickly. An example
      is combining music and drama is capture an experience without having to read
      a lengthy novel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTerminology\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor terminology used in
      Chronostianity:\r\n\r\n-\tAnima Naturalis (latin transliteration: \u2018natural
      soul\u2019): the being that is natural and is contained within that space and
      time.\r\n\r\n-\tExternum Anima (latin of \u2018external soul\u2019): essentially
      is Timekeeper, the being is unnatural and is coming from other time and space.\r\n"
  - chapterName: II. TIMEKEEPER TESTAMENTS
    content: "Timekeeper Testament is a two millenium collection of books compiled
      by Chronostian scholars. \u2018Timekeeper\u2019 is a once myth term that means
      a person who has the ability to explore beyond the worldly realm and see the
      world in multiple versions. While each denomination has different teachings,
      the Timekeeper Testament is the almost universally agreed teachings of Chronostianity.\r\n\r\n\r\nChapters\r\n\r\nTimekeeper
      Testaments are divided into several chapters:\r\n\r\n-\tConcept of Time: Explaining
      how physics works, entropy, general relativity.\r\n\r\n-\tPerception of Time:
      How a living being feels time. Only from a mortal vantage point can understand
      time completely but the existence of Ionis and injection of knowledge may offset
      this understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n-\tHole in the Universe: The Warp Gate, Timekeepers
      and Machine of Madness. How Kronos may intervenes the simulation to enable
      \u2018cheat codes\u2019. These events cannot be comprehend, it is an insoluble
      phenomenon.\r\n\r\n-\tKaiser and his Machine of Madness: How the Kaiser of
      Sixtus manipulated the world to his will through the use of Machine of Madness.\r\n\r\n\r\n-\tCoalition
      of Timekeeper: A faction consists of Timekeepers as a counter against the Sixtusian
      Kaiser. This records their witnesses and the struggle against Kaiser of Sixtus\u2019
      wrath.\r\n"
