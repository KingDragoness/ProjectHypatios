  - chapterName: INTRODUCTIONS
    content: 'Chronostianity is a Zenithian system of thought and behavior originated
      in Great Lantorn Desert. The Chronostians worships Kronos as the God who controls
      time & space of the universe. The religion oriented heavily around the concept
      of time and unlike most Safarian religion, the Chronostianity is a more of
      philosophical, rationalistic religion & critical thinking rather than promoting
      the cult of personality. The origin of the religion was widely accepted from
      the Zenith Federation in the 3rd century BC however no one was sure who created
      the religion.

      

      Its system are semi-centralized with its own
      subdivisions with each has a different doctrines & ideologies. Its own teachings
      & system is revisionist meaning the teachings of the Chronostianity is works
      upon millenias of research of grasping the concept of time, past, future, present
      and state of change. One of the roots of secularism originated from Chronostianity,
      the core is civilistic which promoted social harmony and rejection of supernatural
      or other worldly beliefs that violates civil rights.

  - chapterName: 'I. DOCTRINES '
    content: "Kronos is the central figure of Chronostianity, it is said Kronos is
      the greater untouchable God that is beyond the worldly realm. Due to conflicting
      ideologies between subdivision teachings, for many centuries only the general
      relativity is the generally accepted theory of how time work in the universe
      however the introduction of Warp Gate technology to Safarian race in the 20th
      century caused the Warp Gate Problem which the warp gate is said to have created
      a wormhole for its portal and made 2-way travel nearly instantaneous, this
      destroyed much of the existing theories which allows move backward in time.\r\n\r\nMany
      scholars attempt to explain the problem however many have failed to come to
      a conclusive conclusions. The aftermath of the Warp Gate Problem caused much
      rift within Chronostian, its membership subdivides due to internal disagreement
      of the theories. To this day, the theory is highly divisive & inconclusive,
      with the Reformist believes it\u2019s an \u201Cerror\u201D or a physics \u201Cexploit
      bug\u201D within the universe while the Conservative Chronostian believes there\u2019s
      another unknown law within the general relativity theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nEthics
      & Social\r\n\r\n\r\nChronostians values time above else, Pedis is when someone
      felt bored and time passing felt long, this is regarded as \u201Cgood\u201D,
      bored is when creativity flourished and able to think critically better. Wasting
      time or time felt passing fast is called Alos, this is regarded as \u201Cbad\u201D,
      not bored is a state of work or ignorance, natural consciousness is not working
      and the brain is constantly pre-occupied with the environment without space
      to relax & think critically. \r\n\r\nOne that always felt time is constantly
      passing without sufficient contemplation of the surrounding environment would
      certainly met its doom. Arguably, constant regret and the feeling of life passing-by
      would buildup overtime causing Tiranose Kalos, a phrase that describes a person
      would be cursed to have a internal unrest due to constantly feeling Alos, only
      doing Alos Defusal which the Tiranose Kalos individual is treated by making
      the person as Pedis as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Alos Defusal revolves heavily around
      the phrase of \u201CMay a minute felt like an hour\u201D which a Tiranose Kalos
      individual must felt every minute is precious, time is valuable and the feeling
      of unrest must be purged by having a capability to be stable when he/she isn\u2019t
      doing anything.\r\n\r\nSome Chronostians, may express guilt when they felt
      useless, one that felt he/she is a burden for other people would let a guilt
      feeling of wasting one\u2019s time. Being unpleasant to other people is also
      considered some form of Alos ultimately some hardcore Chronostian may isolate
      themselves as further as possible to prevent becoming a nuisance to others.\r\n"
