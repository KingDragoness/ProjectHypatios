    content: "Vilhaterken is Sixtusian language means 'Will to Resist'. Most people
      lack the will to resist but the will to resist is actually originated from
      strong beliefs and independent thinking. Lust, materiel, power are things we
      need to resist and balance. A little of it is alright but too much will not
      be good for the individual. \r\n\r\nOur inability to resist, succumb our feelings
      and just follow our lowest, shallowest desires is tactical win but a complete
      strategic disaster for the individual. One must not simply easily lured to
      buy things, consume things too easily. We build abstract concepts, learn knowledge
      to establish our newfound resistance to do some things because in the long
      term we genuinely believe it will help us. It also indirectly causes the lowering
      of expectation. The more we are exposed to good things, the more we become
      numb to it. Best to leave the best later.\r\n\r\nGardavian Distance is a term
      means to establish significant distance from the real world and your beliefs.
      Pegging your life-long belief to some real-life people or materiel is absolutely
      dangerous because your plane of reality and illusions are blended together.
      \r\n\r\n-\tIf you believe in something materialistic, like cars, money, fictional
      characters that is made by some people or other, you will be obsessed in something
      you cannot control and most likely cannot own. Fictional characters or franchise
      medias (video games, films) is when the creators will one day disappoint or
      failing to meeting expectations causing the illusion of the franchise\u2019s
      fans shattered.\r\n\r\n-\tThis is a stark contrast compared to example; establishing
      a fantasy world in your head, you will allow a clear wall between reality space
      and your immutable fantasy of the world. Your fantasy world however, must be
      fed with real world information to correct your own fantasy world. Without
      fed with real world information and validations, your perception of the real
      world will be screwed.\r\n\r\n-\tPeople who only simply mimic their beliefs
      are incapable of doing critical thinking. They can easily swallow of the words
      of the preacher without thinking it thoroughly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-\tReligion
      is actually one of the most notorious breeder of stupidity. Religion is somewhat
      an establishment or a shelter to allow echo chamber and cycling stupidity inside.
      Religious hermeneutics allows to take a piece of quote from a religious text
      and then spin in it up to whatever the person wants to do it for. \r\n"
  - chapterName: '[I. DISTANGLE CONNECTION]'
    content: "\r\nDistangle your connection with the world will emancipate any biases
      of the real world and allows unbiased perspective of the world. \r\n\r\nBy
      being in the world, you will find yourself easily swayed opinion of the people.
      Living in an empire of ever-increasing people and multi-racially diverse, it
      creates some kind of paradox. The mind no longer fixated on the inner-self
      but rather the environment and the people, hence communitarianism is supported
      in society. Distancing people from the world allows a better self-introspection
      and diving into greater level of consciousness. \r\n\r\nAnxiety is critical
      of allowing to assess of what\u2019s wrong with us, having close friends validating
      your opinion is a bias because close friends had something to lose when they
      criticize you or had their biases. Mass society are at odds with your close
      friends in that they have no filter in criticism. There is no filter because
      your world with them are distant and very much different.\r\n\r\nHowever, by
      distancing, is not by totally isolate yourself from the world but rather to
      be enlighten by someone who is knowledgeable of the world, a philosophers or
      intellectuals. By being in environment of stupid people, you will become stupid
      unless you raise the people around you to be intellectually the same as you.
      \r\n\r\nThere is ambiguity in that if you are schizophrenic then you must have
      already \u2018out of this world\u2019 or out of touch of reality but the premise
      is simply false. Due to English language bias, people who are schizophrenic
      are not out of this world but rather it is delusional. It is delusional in
      the sense that your senses have overwhelmed you and is controlling your mind.
      The perfect quote is \u2018to emancipate one\u2019s perception from spacetime\u2019,
      to be able to see the totality of the world from the lens of the Gods.\r\n"
