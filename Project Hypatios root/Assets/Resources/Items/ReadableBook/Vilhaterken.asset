    content: '"Legacy system must be purged. All of those previously in power has
      created systems that entangle things matter and any youngsters will be disadvantaged,
      handicapped to the system. Only rich, privilege kids that has over 666 MOBILLION
      CENTURION income per year and extensive free time can possibly learn the ridiculously
      complicated bureaucratic system littered with red tape. Regulations caused
      formalities, conformity, all of this to make bullshit jobs everywhere.



      Hence
      we must wipe the slate clean. If we let inefficiencies of our society unbridled, 
      it will be normalized and its bad effects will be multiplied and increase exponentially.
      Failing to fabricate a good system in the beginning will cause significant
      problem in the future, the so-called problem of ''Don''t fix it if it ain''t
      broke'' will be the dominant form of thinking for these backward caveman-like
      neanderthal people.



      Peace is not a total good. Peace is the root of
      social inmobility because rich family are hereditary by nature, they pass on
      their wealth across the generations to strengthen the future lineups of their
      descendants. Remember that the root of evil is to accept something as unopposingly
      as the force of good. Treating something as morally superior is the epicentre
      of why people cannot see iniquitous things.



      The so-called revolutions
      and mass killings are actually the great social mobility system and adheres
      to the Chaos Theory. We must choke those fat-fuckers, exterminate retarded
      people and throw psychopaths to the seas to purify our society from degradation
      and create a new force of change.



      NIIGGGGGGGEEEEERSS, black skin people
      will always be disadvantaged. We must burn many of the legacy systems that
      exists in our society and rewrite the entire system because if we kept the
      status quo, we are using system that had been formulated by WHITE people for
      centuries from Euro-centric world system. Erase biases that exists in society
      which one''s appearance can be a determinism of one''s future."
