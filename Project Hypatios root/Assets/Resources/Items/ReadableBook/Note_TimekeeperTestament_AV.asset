  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Problems Towards Religions "
    content: "During Sixtusian Occupation of Earth, King Dragoness\u2019 regime has
      major problem with Islam, especially its political movement. Pahliv Aul Said
      being a Timekeeper has caused significant problem by declaring himself Caliph
      and his caliphate movement. The Kaiser regarded the religion as the most toxic
      religion that cannot be removed but must be \u2018neutralized\u2019 by the
      empire. \r\n\r\nWhen he was asked in an interview about Pahliv\u2019s regime
      shortly after the Caliphate\u2019s fall, he responded:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Caliphate
      is a just another rebel group. The Caliphate pretend itself to be \u2018Oh!
      Rise up my brother! It\u2019s jihad time my friend! We- we must rise up against
      the oppression of this alien, Sixtusian Empire and remove elements of colonialism!
      Oh, we are going to get colonized by Safarian aliens!\u2019. All of these idiots
      do is simply resisting technological and societal progress. It is without doubt
      inferior cultures will become obsolete particularly if the cultures have too
      many rules and restrictions. Few of Earth\u2019s culture will retain but the
      retarded ones will be gone, like the forcing women to wear black ninja shinobi
      clothes all the time or in another religion, women become second-class citizen
      or in another, women become conformist and slave to the man. This multiculturism,
      cultural preservation like UNESCO is idiot. Every culture is trash.\u201D\r\n\r\nKaiser
      firmly believes in the Uberwelt, meant superior culture; this superior culture
      was a critical part of the Sixtusian Empire expansion especially on Earth where
      Safarian and Human had great similarities. Sixtusian pop culture has mostly
      successfully permeated to Earth young generations. Sixtusian\u2019 secular
      and popular culture made it easy to integrate and replacing Earth\u2019s internationalist
      young pop culture of gaming, pop culture; K-Pop, Japanese, American, European
      pop culture are quick to be made diminished however in local regions, the local
      culture are still powerful. It is the Earth\u2019s own \u2018international\u2019
      pop culture that is diminishing.\r\n\r\nHowever, Islamic countries was in particular
      hard for Sixtusian culture to enter. These cultures are protectionist, isolationist
      and orthodox in its nature, no matter how strong effort by the Kaiser, it was
      very hard to \u2018replace\u2019 the culture. Kaiser\u2019s hatred of the religion
      does not come with their ideologies but rather in what the Kaiser described
      them being the overly defensive \u2018self-righteous\u2019 defender of the
      faith. How they react, their customs and how they treated other non-believers
      will inevitably cause friction with other cultures. When immigrants started
      to flow in to the empire after the Caliphate collapsed, their refusal to abandon
      their custom clashed with Sixtusian local citizens.\r\n\r\nSixtusian politicians
      somehow mitigate this by creating special district and send them to King Canyon
      Town which is a city overwhelmed with immigrants. However, the KCT city quickly
      sprawled into one of the most dangerous cities with both being the poorest
      and highest crime in the entire nation, every month there\u2019ll be an interethnic/religious
      violence between Muslim or/and other immigrants.\r\n\r\nIn Kaiser\u2019s observation
      he saw the religion\u2019s orthodoxy and haram-ization of bi\u2019dah has caused
      these Muslims to be intellectually backwards. People inside the faith has severe
      restriction or at least feared reprisal or afraid committing of sins. To do
      anything they must consulted to their local religious leader to adhere the
      conventional pieties. Kaiser believes these convoluted, red-tape systems are
      going to kill potential intellectuals and stagnated intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn
      one of his interviews with the state media, he called them and other religions
      out: \r\n\r\n\u201CYou have idiots clinging their faith to millennium-old religion.
      Then every religion, has these \u2018reformers\u2019 and \u2018orthodox\u2019.
      These two factions basically it said itself, one wants to reform to better
      adapt to the new society or the orthodox are basically conservatives who wants
      to going back to the fucking roots or whatever. If you look the retarded Marxist,
      Fairtolic, Safarian Communitarianism, Chronostianity, is the same shit, you
      have one side says, \u2018oh We must going back to the roots! We must adhere
      to the old values!\u2019 then you have idiot hermeneutics analyzer analyzes
      biblical texts, Communist Manifesto, religious texts to interpret or \u2018tafsir\u2019
      the texts and twisted them with mental gymnastics to fit with the \u2018new
      political revivalist movement\u2019. Faggot revivalist movement like the Salafist,
      Jehovah or basically any political movements is technically just to make the
      poor bastard to be brainwashed be ruled by the elites.\u201D\r\n\r\nConversely,
      the Kaiser knows on how to control the populace using religion and cultural
      dominance. While never talked about it on public, the Coalition mentioned how
      the Kaiser\u2019s regime wants to avoid the Arab and India problem where the
      significant Muslim and Hindus were once colonized by Europeans but its culture
      failed to be replaced. Then this failure causes consequences where the Arab
      cultures migrates to Europe and clashes with Europeans\u2019 way of life. \r\n"
