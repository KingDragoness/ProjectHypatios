  allChapters:
  - chapterName: INTRODUCTIONS
    content: "What if a person can screw the world multiple times? What if the consequences
      are under our consciousness and it then became the structure; the status quo;
      the things we accepted with; the new normal? What if the world has written
      by the time travelers? Or the Timekeepers?\r\n\r\nWe always see things from
      a na\xEFve approach when it comes to time-travel or the multiverse. It is always
      seeing the past or the future from the lens of the present, the contemporary.
      Instead, what is more realistic is that a contemporary person stayed in the
      future for some time will become the \u2018person of the future\u2019. Individuals
      are abstract at its core especially social structure are mostly social constructionism,
      artificial in its nature.\r\n\r\nHistory was rewritten. For the humans, it
      was rewritten twice: One is the Sixtusian Empire. Two is the Timekeepers, Machine
      of Madness and the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nFor the Kaiser, is the quest to become a
      God. A quest to become the greatest version one\u2019s self. When the things
      to do in the world are exhausted then the only logical thing to do is to conquer
      everyone and let the hell let loose. The world acts like a canvas for the Kaiser
      to draw and unleash his version of the world to the painting. He envisioned
      the world as made by his imagination, but yet his imagination itself was influenced
      by the world that he recreated. A constant iteration: a thesis, anti-thesis
      and synthesis.\r\n"
  - chapterName: THE ORIGINS
    content: "Like father, like son, Kaiser\u2019s real name is King Dragoness, the
      son of Chigago Dragoness, the dictator of the Sixtusian Junta. Kaiser had a
      massive privilege of being living next to a powerful family with massive wealth
      and family with political dynasty in the Sixtusian Republic. Kaiser gained
      his Timekeeper ability at around 1984, just after the fall of the Sixtusian
      Junta and ad just recently ended its genocide on Eltravivor Empire which was
      a collaborationist state for the Elistar Empire of the Elven race for thousands
      of years and suppressing Safarian race for a/two millennia. During the genocide
      against Eltravivorian, the Dragoness family possess and collects thousands
      of artifacts from the Eltravivorian and eventually, accidentally possess the
      Machine of Madness. With the Machine fall to Kaiser\u2019s hand, he realized
      his Timekeeper ability by rewinding time using the machine; this opened the
      pandora box of the universe.\r\n\r\nKaiser was quick to exploit the machine.
      His family massive wealth reserves enabled Kaiser to do a lot but his family
      was politically destroyed and regarded impossible to return to the Sixtusian
      Republic due to the junta\u2019 oppressive nature and Chigago\u2019s role in
      orchestrating the genocide against Eltravivorian. With his family\u2019s politically
      ruined, Kaiser resented his father significantly and the hatred of his father
      especially his father role in the genocide, that it affected the Kaiser even
      during the Sixtusian Empire era. With bad reputation, Kaiser was constantly
      targeted and bullied by those who resented his father\u2019s rule which he
      had to face a lot during his childhood and even his adulthood that obstruct
      him from living normally that caused Kaiser to pursue the will to power.\r\n\r\nBy
      his mid-20s, Kaiser was able finally return to the Sixtusian Republic thanks
      to his siblings\u2019 corporations\u2019 businesses and wealth to rehabilitate
      their family image, thus Kaiser began expanding his influence in Sixtus by
      becoming industrialist and owning WING Corps. Kaiser eventually dabble with
      Elven technologies and with trial & error, able to produce consumer goods for
      the Elven black market. This business of selling illegal goods to the ruling
      interstellar empire will later became the foundation of how Kaiser will run
      the Sixtusian Empire\u2019s economy.\r\n"
