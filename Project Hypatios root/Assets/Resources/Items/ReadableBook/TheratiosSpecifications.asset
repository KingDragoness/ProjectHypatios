  Title: Theratios Specifications

  - chapterName: INTRODUCTIONS
    content: "Theratios is a high-level Ionis that has the ability to fly, launch
      fireballs and drop explosives. Protocol of the project enforced the insert
      of someone's personality to Theratios, in this case we used \"ELENA\" construct
      to maintain Theratios' personality and consciousness.\r\n\r\n\"ELENA\" construct
      is a 25 year old Mobius Employee female human that died 3 years ago. The profile
      indicated she lacked any family and relatives.\r\n\r\nA year ago, Elena was
      first born as an Ionis but a malfunction causes her to went rogue and caused
      '69 Incident in Hypatios Lab. The incident killed over 200 people, significant
      amount of Mobius Guards were slashed to their deaths by Elena's katana. The
      incident lasted a day before Elena was destroyed by the Heavenblazer mech operated
      by the director of Hypatios Lab, Vendrich. \r\n\r\nTo prevent such incident
      in the future projects, many Ionis in stored were significantly nerfed, its
      personality are manipulated to be much more compliant to any Mobius staffs
      and its knowledge of the world will resembles of a \"Human from pre-Sixtusian
      arrival on Earth in 2016\".\r\n\r\nTheratios is still rogue and is now stored
      safely inside a containment chamber but in case of emergency, now it can be
      killed anytime through the use of console command which can be entered and
      executed by any Mobius Lab members unless the lab director itself set up 'Emergency'
      flag which prevent Theratios from being able to be killed. In emergency mode,
      Theratios will be unshutable and only by accessing the Lab Director's user
      account can it deactivate all Ionis.\r\n"
