  Title: The Meaning of Fanbauxen
  allChapters:
  - chapterName: INTRODUCTIONS
    content: 'As a human scholar who studies Sixtusian culture and politics, I was
      greatly fascinated with the word: ''Fanbauxen'', a famous Sixtusian word roughly
      means to: opportunist. It is used mainly perojatively, to describe people who
      are taking advantage of a situation.

      

      This word was uttered
      significantly over the Sixtusian'' Republic existence, many politicians like
      to use this word to accuse of its opponents as being more of a demagogue and
      populist rather pursuing its own goal and having its own merit. The word is
      a loanword taken from, you guess it: Bunderlife, the Sixtusian'' state famous
      for its high intellectualism, philosophy and scientific output.
