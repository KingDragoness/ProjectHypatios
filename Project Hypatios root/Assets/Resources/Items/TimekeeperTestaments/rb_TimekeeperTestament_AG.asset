  - chapterName: 'Eternal Stage of Social-Capitalism '
    content: "The primary premise of Social-Capitalism is that it assumes a country
      will stuck in an eternal stage of shifting between centralization and decentralization
      policies. It emphasizes the importance of both welfarism and centralization
      of wealth. Accumulation of wealth is good and in fact, mandatory as it acts
      a buffer for emergency fund or concentration of wealth to enable project development
      with tight controls and the leader\u2019s \u2018authoritarianist\u2019 vision
      which can potentially benefits the masses. On the other hand, the idea of distributing
      wealth is good because it allows small people to contribute society\u2019s
      complex system to have adaption, feedback loops and emergence which can innovate.
      A perpetual stage of socialism and capitalism, the anti-caste and feudalism.
      The anti-caste, \u2018communist\u2019 society is an inefficient society where
      division of labour is limited hence productivity is fall. Feudalist society
      is an efficient society, productivity is high but the means of production is
      stripped away from the artisans or craftsmen. \r\n\r\nThe Sixtusian Empire
      is the only empire that adheres to this ideology. Other empires like Elistar,
      United Dionary Empire, Alpha Empire which has existed for thousands of years
      all developed into semi-feudalist empire with caste system and strong separation
      of classes. This is because feudalist structure allows high stability at the
      cost weak reforms and low innovation. The caste system allows for highly efficient
      society which the labour is properly divided from one\u2019s birth. With this,
      the Elistar, UDE and Alpha has practically turned its working class to a total
      alienation where they all has lost the ability determine to its own life and
      destiny.\r\n\r\nWhen the UDE lost the War of the Universe in 2036, the Sixtusian
      Empire forced the UDE to open up its economy and rapidly introduced new machinery
      which fundamentally changed UDE\u2019s social-economic structure to social-capitalism,
      causing a massive chaos. Sixtusian reforms to UDE\u2019s economy is using Dionarian
      as their cheap labourers while the Sixtusian gradually becomes the capitalists,
      dictate the goods to be produced, hence liberating Sixtusian\u2019 workforce.
      These had major consequences:\r\n\r\nFirst, Sixtusian forces all UDE\u2019s
      subject states to major land reforms. UDE subjects that were republics or had
      high liberty are fundamentally unchanged by this policy but monarchy-like subject
      states which are the dominant government form of many UDE\u2019s subjects quickly
      fall into chaos. The ambitious target set by Sixtusian government to UDE monarchy-like
      subject state was unable to keep up. The enforcement by the Sixtusian Outerboundary
      to the local ruling class were brutal. When they successfully met Sixtusian\u2019
      demands, it was met with a revolt by the lower class of Dionarians against
      their landlords and aristocrat classes due to bad working conditions and harsh
      enforcement of the law. In some places, Dionarian launched massive classicide
      against the upper class, causing the Sixtusian Outerboundary to forcibly take
      control of the dysfunctional government.\r\n\r\nDespite the totalitarian nature
      of Kaiser\u2019s rule, Kaiser vehemently opposed authoritarianism. He argued
      authoritarianism is awful in every way unless implementing democracy was so
      dire and implausible that authoritarian government is the only way out from
      the dreadful situation. Kaiser noted the great discord of developing and developed
      countries, where developed nations proclaim democracy is an absolute, universalist
      value needed to be upheld by everyone. The paradox is that for example: Western
      developed democratic countries provides safe haven. If a person from undeveloped
      countries is becoming unstable, they easily able to escape to Europe or United
      States. If Europe or United States is becoming unstable, those citizens became
      cornered fox hence the only way out is they have to force themselves to defend
      their own country rather than escaping. Western developed countries itself
      are enabling the authoritarianism itself: collecting wealth using corruption
      then spent luxury goods created by Western countries. Freedom and democracy
      espoused by Earth\u2019s western countries is simply a gimmick according to
      the Kaiser. The only real driving force is economy where some degree of democracy
      is implemented to supply the drive of scientific endeavours.\r\n\r\nIn terms
      of ideology, Kaiser is much in line of Chinese\u2019s main tenet of \u2018moderately
      prosperous society\u2019. He called Western pro-capitalist society has caused
      unchecked, reckless production and demand of consumer goods. Creeping normality,
      increasing baseline of people\u2019s living standard. Kaiser called for the
      balance between the party and the capitalists, tipping too much to the party
      and you will get a mad ultra-leftist revolution policies which will get too
      \u2018revolutionary\u2019 or too much state control. While tipping too much
      to the capitalist will cause an endemic corrupt society that stuck in a perpetual
      stage of feudalist, highly stratified society. \r\n\r\nKaiser noted Chinese
      political system is the greatest threat to the Western world until the arrival
      of the Sixtusian Empire in 2016. China had a political system that is developed
      independently from Western civilization. Japan and South Korea simply mimics
      the Western political system while China evolves not from Western democracies
      but rather from Soviet system. The foundation is different. If 20 countries
      are derivative forms from Western system then if one country has a unique political
      system then it will stand out and benefits by simply being different. 20 countries
      of Western system will be oversaturated and each of them will mimics its advantages
      and disadvantages causing no distinct comparative advantage. This is why enforcing
      every country to have the same system of democracy is impossible. Kaiser told
      that forcing every country to adopt the level of democracy, freedom of press
      and human rights that is acceptable to the United States would be impossible
      since those who adopts it will be trailing behind; they will be naturally disadvantaged.
      Those who obeys, follow the rules and then surpass the West, will be screwed
      by the Western powers as they hold the power of changing the rules of international
      politics. \r\n\r\nBasic logic and pragmatism made it absolutely clear that
      once other countries started to catch up, the West will be threatened. Kaiser
      argued they will change the rule and build some kind narrative to make other
      country constantly in \u2018backward stage\u2019 using its progressivism, LGBT,
      freedom narrative. In addition, they will set the normalcy standard which they
      know other countries cannot attained to. Build a strong enough paradise to
      entice immigrants and intellectuals to get out from their countries and live
      in the West. Kaiser told this is an obvious \u2018public secret\u2019:\r\n\r\n\u201CSixtus
      did this too with its immigration and attracting intellectuals. Except we don\u2019t
      lie with freedom and democracy. We openly admitted a system alternating between
      authoritarianism and democracy whenever we needed them the most. Our authoritarian
      system is meant rules can be skipped over but independency of our electoral
      agency is absolute and people can vote their leaders out.\u201D\r\n\r\nObviously,
      Kaiser\u2019s 24-year regime is a direct contradiction to that statement but
      the Sixtusian Republic is non-committal to any governmental system. It is a
      social-capitalist state where system can be flexible, basically a pragmatist
      state to its core. \r\n\r\nSociety that was tended more on capitalistic/feudalistic
      society, the upper class reigned pretty powerful in that they are highly materialistic,
      allocating its economy more on production of consumers goods and/or commodities
      than scientific endeavours. In this stage, accumulation of wealth by either
      the government or private sector are normalized. It is a society where the
      rich live in the mansion and separate itself from the working class. The global
      market\u2019s demands will cause the economy of a country becoming like this.\r\n\r\nAccording
      to social-capitalist theory, a true socialist state is something that is impossible
      to achieve but the main goal is keep getting closer to it. The means of production
      must be possessed to as many individuals as possible; everyone must be able
      to produce goods on them according to its needs and by its ability. The primary
      way to possess the production is delegate its productions to machinery as much
      as possible. However, a nationalistic socialist, might ignore other country\u2019s
      welfare thus can offshoring to other countries, hence causing other country
      fall into feudalistic society while \u2018our country\u2019 will become \u2018socialist\u2019
      while dictating the other country\u2019s productions thus, in externally, it
      becomes a state capitalist while internally, becomes a socialist, welfare state.\r\n\r\nIn
      socialist society, ideas and metaphysics were prioritized. A socialist society
      has a good welfare system with the state providing a lot of welfare. Private
      entities delegating its powers to the government by paying taxes to fund infrastructure
      and others so it can focus on other things. \r\n\r\nThe line of the rich and
      the poor is blur especially for the middle class who were floating midway between
      having enough money for everyday life but barely has the capital to start a
      business. For every class society, the lower class will always look up to the
      higher class. For the middle class, they tended to have romanticism of \u2018exploring
      the world\u2019 or live the perfect financial freedom. For the \u2018real\u2019
      upper class, the system of society forced them into a position to help the
      others, hence \u2018investors\u2019 or \u2018capitalist\u2019: to give money
      to the middle class to grow their business up. Every class have a different
      \u2018spirit\u2019, everyone might have different occupation but the system
      eventually conforms people to a common pattern. \r\n\r\nDividing people into
      classes were not an attempt for reductionism or overly simplification but people\u2019s
      psychology tended to like to group because simplification or stereotype one\u2019s
      identity is imperative due to an abundance amount of people living in this
      world hence, we need reductionist approach when encountering people or \u2018NPC\u2019
      to better organize society.\r\n\r\nEarth and Safar have great similarities
      hence why the Kaiser put special attention to them. They roughly placed at
      the same socio, economic, political situation where they have balanced elements
      of socialism and feudalism.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Diminishing Return of Everything '
    content: "When doing anything, the effort to do something might increases linearly
      while the result will be increasingly diminishing. An example if an industry
      is on the breakthrough and at its infancy, the effort to do and capital is
      less but the result can be either success or fail. Once an industry matured,
      the entry point will be increasingly getting difficult and only those with
      great capital can truly succeed. With an increasing amount of time, the proportion
      of a single individual impact to an industry will be increasingly diminishing.\r\n\r\nIn
      a saturated market, our efforts to do something will be difficult. Competition
      will be fierce, with it our effort can be disproportion to the results. We
      can be in an industry for 5 years but stuck in a stage of failure while a lucky
      person can surpass us in just 1 year. There will be a threshold maximum year
      of experience until it started to be diminishing. A person can only remember
      limited things at a time. However, those who stuck in a stage of failure will
      have greater \u2018potential\u2019 while those who were in pre-mature success
      are fundamentally will be weaker and not diving deeper into the consciousness
      hence limiting its potentiality to become the greatest version of one\u2019s
      self. \r\n\r\nSometimes the best way to compete is not to compete directly
      at all, we want to totally avoid competition. Instead, we use comparative advantages,
      satisfying demands and frustration of people while the competitors didn\u2019t
      have. Through loop holes, one must navigate and initiate extensive research
      to find the loop hole and find a way to executes it. The loop holes can be
      in laws, technical, economics, market, etc. A fanbauxen, opportunist. It is
      the will to power to shove off the status quo, an agent of destroyer.\r\n\r\nIn
      an industry like the music industry, the lobby was powerful and the determinant
      of success was not skills and talents but rather it is marketing, the ability
      music to the masses. It is commodity. Because of its commoditization, the means
      of producing of music is now delegated to big studios and the entertainment
      giants. Generalists were usually common for pioneers but thanks to commoditization,
      there is division of labour of \u2018specialists\u2019, people who have specialized
      and diving deep on one subject only.\r\n\r\nIt is best not to be na\xEFve.
      A common theme of people across generations is the \u2018live a life\u2019
      pursuit, they pick an occupation or interest and then self-confines themselves
      into that box: a programmer sticks to role playing games as if their identity
      is locked into it. If lucky, then living a life can be worth it: comfort and
      stability. But sometimes a major event in the comes from agent of destroyers:
      an AI that create art on its own, writing its own song and art. Due to 2d artist
      producing \u2018commission art\u2019 is a commodity good, AI could easily replace
      it. This is different from high-profile artist who already have attach its
      name and establishing branding. With this chaos, the effort of creating art
      manually on scale is becoming unsustainable.\r\n"
