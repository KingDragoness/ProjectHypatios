  - chapterName: 'Presentation of Information '
    content: "Presentation of information is key for Timekeepers. Language structure
      can influenced one\u2019s understanding of the world. An example: Time is length
      in English (how long?) while time is size or quantity in other language (\u591A\u957F
      or how many?). It may be a subtle difference but trickling down, it will be
      significant on high level that will impact one\u2019s ability to write poems,
      texts and interpretation of the world.\r\n\r\nA major problem with \u2018hook\u2019
      of information: a scholar or a theorist writes and formulated new ideas and
      theories however in the eyes of common public, they will always take the low
      hanging fruit. This low hanging fruit are most likely the most na\xEFve and
      incomplete statement of their work due to its accessibility. This caused a
      bias where the public can easily criticize one\u2019s theory by only looking
      its low hanging fruit, when in fact, they did not sees the totality of one\u2019s
      work.\r\n\r\nA person ability to take in an information can be obstructed by
      the economic situation of a person or the health of it. The health is pretty
      obvious, dysfunctional organ will make the body succumb to its pains and excessive
      focus on the body rather the realm of the mind. \r\n\r\nIn terms of economics,
      in this current epoch, it is not the access of the information anymore is the
      problem but rather the focus and the incentives of it. Imagine a person works
      as a driver delivering stuffs or carrying people, when working for long hour,
      it will not be able to focus on reading one hour of texts or an article reliably.
      The situation was not conducive. The hyperactivity of social media has caused
      somewhat of a short attention span for many people. A person working in tight
      schedule and shifts will acclimatize to shorts videos and is encouraged to
      watch it. The presentation of information in short videos as a consequence
      will be short and incomplete, causing a knowledge gap. It is an incomplete
      information.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to educatize the populace if the only way to
      survive or earn a living is by working 9 hours, 6 days a week. The only way
      to improve intelligence is to disincentive work that were \u2018easy\u2019,
      manual and lack of use of people\u2019s brain. The consumer goods and entertainment
      industry has created a system where people were incentivized to make easy money
      from consumerism. Fast moving consumer goods makes people filthy rich and once
      they are at the top, intelligence will stagnate. Hence, expression of information
      will be limited, incomplete and/or inaccurate.\r\n\r\nExtroverts are the embodiment
      of mass society. Extroverts has a lot of people on their side, this caused
      them weak at certain endeavours like: science or involve in research and development.
      Their language tends to be unsophisticated and lacking in verbose. But a person
      who shifting personalities between introvert and extrovert is the best world.
      Extroversion when it was needed the most: public conventions, socializing.
      Introversion to self-correct mistakes and unlock the potentiality of one\u2019s
      self. The perspective of many is imperative to be able posit ourselves to someone\u2019s
      position. This will make one become able to speak in their language and quickly
      able to convince them.\r\n\r\nA closer look at presenting the information:
      if there\u2019s a stigmatization of learning a language. Sometimes in a third
      world country: a person studying or attempt to speak English will be mocked
      as \u2018smart-ass\u2019. The worse, is that when 8 out of 10 people cannot
      speak English then we\u2019ll be dragged into the environment of poor English
      language hence destroying a gateway to a greater knowledge when English itself
      is the most common and extensive language used around the globe.\r\n\r\nOne
      of the worst aspects of presenting an information is when society sanctioned
      an individual who attempts to find a good side of it and even discuss it. This
      becomes a problem for Timekeeper when presenting an information in the past
      or at certain epoch when the stigma persisted. \r\n\r\nEntry point of a person
      to learn something can halted by the current political situation of a certain
      epoch. In some places, the ecosystem can prevent or slowed down one\u2019s
      ability to mould into a certain type of identity. Developing countries or \u2018newly
      industrialized\u2019 economies tends to be disadvantageous for intellectuals,
      it encourages people to become a labourer. Learning which takes time and not
      all are able to expense their time to learn. The economic system can discourage
      an individual to learn or study and instead dragged him to the lower skill
      workforce which downgraded its intelligence. Usually, these lower skill labours
      are consumerism goods, fast moving goods, luxury goods designed to distract
      the masses or built as a status wealth validation. \r\n\r\nMaterialism or \u2018seeing
      things directly in the field\u2019 rather presenting a theory or story, is
      the fastest to spark one\u2019s imagination. To imagine or think takes time
      hence the only way to present information the best is by direct experience.
      This is why people; society needs a status wealth symbol. This is hard, real
      proof of one\u2019s status. The behaviour of the mass society reflect itself:
      if a handsome person did wrongdoings, he will be forgiven for his mistakes,
      \u2018naive\u2019. If an ugly, unattractive person did wrongdoings, then he
      will be persecuted. These stereotypes rooted from cultural legacy systems are
      causing the entry point for certain people: disadvantageous.\r\n\r\nMob mentality;
      the mass society rules. It became dictatorship of the masses. Information is
      not stored on the digital space or the book rather it is stored in everyone\u2019s
      brain, chain-linked together into some kind of collective intelligence, collective
      consciousness. The one who wins are the one who were to present well and agreed
      by the consensus. That is why presenting an information cannot be directly,
      it must incremental, step-by-step instructions. The environment and cultures
      at a certain epoch might not allow for new ideas hence good ideas will die
      in darkness. The structure of society, political revolution is imperative to
      unlock new ways that\u2019s not thought by the contemporaries. It is like moving
      on Z axis, to strip the system out in order for new system to thrive.\r\n\r\nIneffective
      presentation is the next major problem. At one epoch or generation, one occupation
      is desirable than the other, for example: becoming a doctor and an engineer
      was once desirable but now it is to become a \u2018celebrity\u2019. This role
      model shifting can shift the culture and potentially, a certain style of presentation
      of information can be ineffective. When culture shifts, the language changed
      thanks to generational changes. If the teacher retains its obsolete style of
      information then the young students will be in different language even if the
      language is the same. The truth cannot prevail if you cannot speak in their
      language.\r\n\r\nIt is not the truth of information mattered but the presentation,
      the packaging mattered. This is because a biological being has multiple senses
      which if a piece of media can tell a story from multiple senses, receptors
      (vision, sound, moving picture, emotion, context), then it will sped up the
      learning/comprehension process.  \r\n\r\nOne of the greatest fears of presenting
      an information is when a thing becomes \u2018commoditized\u2019 rather than
      artistic medium. A culture like Indonesian\u2019 art, Japanese art, Chinese
      art has become a \u2018commodity exotic\u2019 item rather than art. Video game
      for example, has sometimes been commoditized in that it became commercial product
      and since it is commercial, consumers had the audacity to dictate one\u2019s
      work without restriction. These commoditization of things and medias has turned
      things into generic, incorporate itself to a structure rather than one\u2019s
      artistic expression. \r\n\r\nUsually the packaging an information is best when
      bundled with other stuffs. Simply creating a book in these days is not enough
      because books are no longer the frontier of expression, it has been commoditized
      to become someone\u2019s achievement or portfolio rather than truly freedom
      of expression. Instead it could be presented in all-in-one package rather than
      one book per subject or topic. The all-in-one package is the best type of delivering
      information especially in an era of oversaturated medias. Returning to basic
      economics and business fundamentals, if there are too many fragmented piece
      of media, too many movies, video games, music then it will be oversaturated
      in the market, hence people would only return to what\u2019s familiar to them,
      a safe zone like a famous franchise recycled through reboots or remasters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmalgamate
      several things into a product like video games can have interactive elements,
      music, lore, dialogues and many others unlocked many possibilities of unprecedented
      presentation of information. Some argue it would an absolute waste that if
      video games are gated only for fun or simply a commercial product that simply
      uses stupid gamification metrics rather than a freedom of expression.\r\n\r\nThe
      compartmentalization of disciplines of studies created a problem of not seeing
      the whole picture or not understanding things in its totality. Putting scientists
      in a box will not produce intellectuals instead scientist will only become
      a job, a labourer, a proletariat and this is one of side effects of unchecked
      capitalist world has done to damage intellectualism. The greatest innovators
      are those with perspective of many and learning from many disciplines, a generalists
      and those who are willing to step outside of the rules.\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Timekeeper Testaments '
    content: "The Timekeeper Testaments book originated from Chronostianity which
      originally about the nature of time, perception of time/chronoception, psychology,
      historicism, philosophy and metaphysics; eventually evolved to studies of Timekeepers,
      the consequences of Kaiser\u2019s actions & the Machine of Madness and the
      evolution of the Sixtusian Empire. Timekeeper Testaments are basically structured
      as an anthology, a collection of literary works by Timekeepers and scholars.
      The part of Sixtusian Empire and Kaiser were written and maintained by the
      Coalition of Timekeepers.\r\n\r\nThe existence of Timekeepers is totally impossible
      to be proven for non-Timekeepers so this is treated mainly as a fiction for
      many readers of this text. For many, it is the tales, story, an all-in-one
      text ranging from economics, psychology, Kaiser\u2019s decisions, historicism
      and philosophy that made it significant.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Agent of Destroyer and Greatest Version of One\u2019s Self "
    content: "Agent of Destroyer is an entity (like the Kaiser) who screwed up the
      entire universe and makes the world revolves around him. It shatters the status
      quo structure of the world and replace it with a new building above its foundation;
      wiping the slate clean. Kaiser described as the agent of destroyer that screw
      up the universe:\r\n\r\n\u201CEverything he touches, he screws them all up.\u201D\r\n\r\nReaching
      \u2018greatest version of One\u2019s self\u2019 is unfortunately sometimes
      to become an agent of destroyer. Deprioritize other people and let the spotlight
      to ourselves, shifting material and give more powers to ourselves, a game theory
      where we win. \r\n\r\nA person needs to be in a situation where they can be
      both becoming a slave and a master. In the mode being a \u2018master\u2019,
      we need some inferior people, to repress of so we can direct orders, a listener
      that we can talk to. In the mode of \u2018slave\u2019, we became an obedient,
      constantly in state of \u2018being-told\u2019, surrendering our body and modes
      of production to the master. The ability to switching between master and slave
      is essentially social mobility and self-correcting our mistakes. It can be
      that a rich person is acting dominant in front of its employees but acting
      soft in his family. This dynamic is crucial for social mobility and correcting
      our mistakes. \r\n\r\nGreatest version of one\u2019s self can be hindered by
      the society attempts to confine a person to be conformed to the norms, be a
      \u2018tool\u2019 or an employee for someone. Sometimes when we push out, society
      will push us down. One needs to have the courage and will to break from the
      conformity.\r\n\r\nThere was graph, an equation of like the \u2018Dunning-Kruger\u2019
      effect that suggested the balance of \u2018what we know that we don\u2019t
      know\u2019 as X axis and \u2018what we don\u2019t know that we don\u2019t know\u2019
      as Y axis. Those who tended more on the X axis will be people that is vulnerable,
      knows he is lacking, unskilled and he will be humble, low confidence. Those
      who were high on the Y axis is the person mostly likely who overestimated his
      abilities. When we want to know something, we are taking a forbidden knowledge.
      Once we know it, it is hard to reverse it. With it, we must acknowledge the
      risk beforehand and our ability before taking in the \u2018pill\u2019. Naivety
      of a person must be preserved because not person is ready to become a great
      person. Pre-mature forbidden knowledge will screw up a person especially when
      the person isn\u2019t ready to take it.\r\n\r\nSomewhat ties to \u2018presentation
      of information\u2019. Exposing something to a kid may accidentally causes a
      traumatic experience. Example is that if a person got destroyed in their childhood,
      that person will take in the forbidden knowledge of \u2018hard truth of reality\u2019
      and \u2018social isolation\u2019 thus can prevented a person from socializing
      properly in their adulthood. If a person has a good childhood, its na\xEFve-ness
      will be retained hence they will not take in the forbidden knowledge of \u2018social
      ethics\u2019 and \u2018social isolation\u2019 prematurely. It is best to prevent
      a child from gaining consciousness because it can cause trauma and hesitation
      leading the prevention of greatest version of one\u2019s self.\r\n\r\nAn agent
      of destroyer is essentially an \u2018immigrant\u2019, an \u2018alien\u2019
      who has different spirit and is not part of the NPC group. It attempts to attack
      against the current epoch by screwing up the foundations of it because it sees
      the structure of the world as insane or unstable.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Attack against the Current Epoch '
    content: "Attack against the current epoch is essentially attacking and treating
      the present as a madness. A Timekeeper coming back from future (died in 2040
      then loops back to 2020) will sometimes see in the past with two possibilities:
      nostalgia or madness. Nostalgia are past things that retains even in the present,
      it influenced our thinking and current culture. Madness are things that have
      not incorporated into our society, abandoned and exclusively only exists within
      that period of time.\r\n\r\nA temporary state of madness is part of critical
      theory term as to refer a certain action is regarded as a total madness especially
      that action is not part of the structure of society of the observer. Kaiser
      refer this sudden madness as being \u2018possess by the demons\u2019. The temporary
      state of madness happens multiple times in history:\r\n\u2022\tIn a race riot
      in the United States in 2020, many jumped into the boat of where some progressive
      white people felt extreme guilt of treating the blacks badly and the black
      people reigned supreme by rioting and looting the stores. This is example of
      mass society possessed by demons according to the Kaiser because there were
      literally at lowest point in history of racial discrimination and totally disillusioned
      with reality. By the next year, those supporting the racial movements were
      totally died down and many looking back as a period of madness.\r\n\u2022\tA
      mass killing is a perfect example of temporary state of madness. People became
      disillusioned and mad through mob mentality and mobilization of unleashing
      the beast where they had repressed their anger and their true feelings.\r\n\u2022\tNazi
      Germany where people became mass-hypnotized by the Fuhrer and became a murderous
      rampage killing millions of people. After the war, Nazism was totally destroyed
      from its core and it was regarded as the period of people becoming mad.\r\n\r\nAttack
      against the current epoch is the idea that one could attack things on the present
      time because the person that sees the world of today will look at it as a crazy,
      mad era; an alienation. The person was estranged thanks to the zeitgeist of
      a particular era that contradicts a person\u2019s spirit. \r\n\r\nHowever,
      Timekeeper is still entangled to a period of time. How Timekeepers loops is
      strictly limited by its lifespan. A Timekeeper living in the medieval era with
      60 years of lifespan will always stays at medieval era, it will stuck at that
      epoch. \r\n\r\nBut what Kaiser\u2019s dominance of the galaxy is a truly an
      exceptional and unrepeatable phenomenon: the epoch of the Kaiser\u2019s if
      undisturbed by Timekeeper and Machine of Madness bullshit, was said to continuing
      the status quo where the UDE, Alpha and Elistar Empire will stays on power
      while the Sixtusian Republic stay on course as a country littered with progressives
      and under the rule of social-capitalism. What happened is that it is truly
      a great attack of the current epoch. It is not deterministic at all or the
      zeitgeist of the era, rather Kaiser\u2019s deliberately attacks the zeitgeist,
      spirit of the era and twisted it to Kaiser\u2019s spirit. Essentially, transcending
      Kaiser as practically near God-like status.\r\n"
