  Title: Timekeeper Testaments
  allChapters:
  - chapterName: Forbidden Knowledge
    content: "The most central theme of Timekeepers is bringing a forbidden knowledge
      from the future and bringing to the past/present, causing a paradox. A forbidden
      knowledge may cause different reaction depending on the people, its reaction
      will be depending on the conditionality of the world, its physical & mental
      state upon thrown into the world in a specified space and time, its comprehension
      of the world, its entanglement to the world and its motivation. \r\n\r\nWhen
      a person gains Timekeeper ability for the first time is to change the past.
      With temporality breaks down, one could attempt to experience many things previously
      unthought of or impossible to commit by non-Timekeepers. The amount of thing
      a Timekeeper can do to change things or experience many things are linked to
      how many people exists in a society during at certain space and time. Having
      Timekeeper in the ancient times will have lesser effect than in modern time
      where chaos theory is very prevalent. A Timekeeper in modern times will have
      a chance to change its identity as many times as it wants.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence
      of these forbidden identity changes and gaining knowledge previously unthought,
      a Timekeeper will grow to develop a rigorous critical theorist. Learning all
      major social science from psychology, history to economics & game theory, all
      will be essential in understanding a society in its totality.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism
      of Timekeeper and how it works never fully understood, many believe it was
      simply an error in the universe that all Timekeepers simply fully accepts.
      The study of Timekeeper works never mattered, it is perhaps a being that was
      thrown in to the world by God to see the effect of how much chaos will be inflicted
      if one could bring a forbidden knowledge from the future.\r\n"
