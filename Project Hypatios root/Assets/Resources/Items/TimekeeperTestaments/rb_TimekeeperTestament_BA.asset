  - chapterName: Forbidden Knowledge
    content: "The most central theme of Timekeepers is bringing a forbidden knowledge
      from the future and bringing to the past/present, causing a paradox. A forbidden
      knowledge has widely interpretation depending on one\u2019s intelligence capability
      to comprehend it; it is relativism. \r\n\r\nPerson that gains Timekeeper ability
      for the first time: to change the past. With temporality breaks down, one could
      attempt to experience many things previously unthought of or impossible to
      commit by non-Timekeepers. The amount of thing a Timekeeper can do to change
      a society are depends on what time of era it is in. Timekeeper in the ancient
      times will have lesser effect than in modern time where chaos theory is very
      prevalent in modern times. It ties back to basic philosophy where the whole
      world existence is basically stored in the collective consciousness of the
      masses. A billboard or a sign has no meaning for animals, only those who understands
      will it be stored in the people\u2019s mind. Nudging things in modern times
      will ripples greatly across space and time.\r\n\r\nWith the Machine of Madness,
      these collective memories from previous timelines are stored in every Timekeeper\u2019s
      minds (who is alive and obtained the Timekeeper ability at certain point of
      time). During Kaiser\u2019s possession of the machine, Timekeepers were always
      notified before the time vortex activated, even those who were opposed the
      Kaiser. Kaiser has strict protocol for \u2018rewinding time\u2019, only rewinds
      it when it was absolutely necessary or the outcome of events were putting Kaiser
      at disadvantaged position.\r\n\r\nThe Machine of Madness had little to no recorded
      history before Kaiser\u2019s possession. The advent of computer and internet
      blessed Timekeepers with ability to reliable and quick information handling
      which unlocks significant new abilities for Timekeepers. Timekeepers without
      the Machine of Madness, are essentially living in their own bubble which they
      can live freely from any Timekeeper interference. The Machine changed the fundamentals
      totally. The Machine reintroduced some kind of linearity to Timekeepers in
      which Timekeepers are at the mercy of the Machine\u2019s time vortex and they
      are no longer in the bubble, the Timekeepers events were shared amongst them
      all. \r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the Machine, information of the \u2018multiverse\u2019
      (from previous timeline) are persistent and held in the collective consciousness
      of the Timekeepers. It is a block of information chained together, floated
      in every Timekeeper\u2019s head.\r\n\r\n\u201CA Timekeeper is bringing a forbidden
      knowledge from the future. There a Timekeeper will upset the next timeline.
      Causing a paradox.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo understand how Timekeeper can screw a world,
      we need to challenge our conventional epistemology. A Timekeeper paradoxically
      brings a piece of information to the past, screwing the past. But a raw of
      piece information cannot be swallowed raw by the masses. To be able to present
      it, a Timekeeper must serve the \u2018meal from the future\u2019 with whatever
      ingredients available in the past. One must cook it, present the information
      in the right manner depending on the historical era. A valid information is
      useless if one cannot present it in the right order. When it was presented
      well, one can potentially upset the past by bringing forbidden knowledge. \r\n\r\n\u201CEven
      the right information but presented in the wrong order will only cause confusion.
      A piece of information is sticky to context.\u201D\r\n\r\nAbstract concepts
      are less entangled to spacetime, example: Mathematics are very abstract while
      sociology & economics are extremely sensitive to disturbance. One nudge can
      completely change the direction of the future.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe hierarchical
      complex system from impossible to be nudged to the most extreme case of butterfly
      effect: Mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, social science. When deconstructing
      it to more abstract-level:\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe law of math defines physics
      but not the way around.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe law of physics defines chemistry
      but not the way around.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd the law of biology defines psychology
      but not the way around. Basically, disciplinary linearity.\u201D"
  - chapterName: 'Superformula and the Problem of Learning '
    content: "The brain of an individual being is limited which made it impossible
      for Timekeepers to remember everything. The ability to a create some kind of
      Superformula is needed to learn and grasp every concept quickly. It is the
      \u2018pattern\u2019 that emerges in every discipline.\r\n\r\nOne of the prominent
      superformula is the \u2018complex system\u2019. It appears everywhere, one
      that has grasp on complex system will immediately able to analyze the subjects
      of many fields such as sociology, economics, biology, computer science, statistics
      and many others. \r\n\r\nBut even with superformula, Timekeepers cannot simply
      learn everything and able to become a God. A Timekeeper cannot build a panzer
      or a tank if it has no industrial capability or the societal condition to trigger.
      It needs to shape its near environment by teaching the people in the past but
      this comes with the problem of \u2018learning\u2019.\r\n\r\nTo teach people
      to build a tank, requires a significant change of one\u2019s societal condition
      or environment itself. We always have some problem of seeing the past from
      the present lens, hence we couldn\u2019t even see the lens of the person who
      has never seen or even heard the idea of a \u2018tank\u2019. We need significant
      contextualization by giving instructions step by step. But the major problem
      is one\u2019s imagination can be limited; to imagine is sometimes you need
      to build the material or the thing first. Contextualize a tank in the 1880s
      for example; imagine an artillery attached to a car then the car is made of
      steel. With that, people in that era can grasp the idea of it. But things like
      computer is completely unfathomable with that era, the only way to show it
      is by actually to show the thing. \r\n\r\nThis is what is called \u2018Impossible
      Imagination\u2019, some things were simply impossible to be imagined by people.
      The notion of \u2018imagination has no limit\u2019 is bullshit. A person bend
      to the shape of the universe and reality first before diving into metaphysical
      stuffs. One does not comprehend or being conscious without becoming a being
      first; becoming a human or a robot that has the ability to think. \r\n\r\nWhen
      we see innovation, we see it as some kind of mankind\u2019s \u2018free-will\u2019
      but if we look the past from the present, we accept it as a status quo or \u2018normalization\u2019.
      Arabic numerals of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 has effectively override our fundamental
      understanding of numbers and even math itself completely. When we introduced
      to Arabic numerals the first time, we may think it as revolutionary but overtime,
      we accept it and became \u2018normalize\u2019.\r\n\r\nWith atoms and energy
      constantly conserved and cannot be created nor destroyed, the world is not
      free but it is a determinist, contingency world. The imagination of a person
      is just the will of the future.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Chaos Theory, Emergence and Complex Systems '
    content: "As a Timekeeper, we can see the parallels of the many universe, each
      with its own slight variations. Chaos theory is very visible for Timekeepers,
      in fact it is one of the first thing that we are able to notice. We saw living
      beings are extremely susceptible to changes, it is like chain reaction, its
      direction can be absolutely unpredictable and within just a week, events from
      far away that supposed to happened, changed because of the minuscule of our
      actions. However not everything is a butterfly effect. Things that Timekeepers
      wants to affect can be nullified by the \u201COpposite Forces\u201D. These
      opposite forces are for example, you want to manipulate a person but then gets
      negated by their relatives or friends. A major event with lacking in complex
      system: earthquakes, volcanic explosion and asteroid strikes can be very predictable
      and very hard to be manipulated, it tends to be very persistent and no Timekeeper
      could even stop it unless they completely destroy the planet using nukes.\r\n\r\nSystems
      with greater complexity are easily manipulated by Timekeepers. Systems that
      are complex are indicated by its non-linearity, emergence, spontaneous order,
      feedback loop. A Bunderlifean scholar explains regarding spontaneous order:\r\n\r\n\u201CThings
      seemingly stupid but if multiplied into millions will becomes intelligent.
      New properties emerge from dumb things. The input needs to be able to take
      from the output, allowing iterative changes and constant improvement. Chaos
      will accidentally create order.\u201D\r\n\r\nEvery individual in the world
      have a task given to them. If all only do one task or only worked in agriculture
      then it will be a very unproductive society, instead every person must delegate
      its task to something, a function. A totalitarian state would be very ineffective
      form of government unless the leader is a God-like figure that knows a forbidden
      knowledge from the future (like the Kaiser). Usually a totalitarian system
      kills the imagination of a person, it takes a very na\xEFve approach of only
      designing a society only from its surface rather than having faith on the populace
      to create emergence mechanics.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Existence of God '
    content: "Basically, there are 4 possibilities for the existence of God: \u2018God
      does exist\u2019, \u2018God never exist\u2019, \u2018God will exist\u2019 and
      \u2018God no longer exist\u2019. \u2018God does exist\u2019 are basically theism,
      believes the existence of a greater deity out there. \u2018God never exist\u2019
      are atheism or agnostic and doesn\u2019t believe a greater deity out there.
      \u2018God will exist\u2019 are a belief that thinks the greater deity is our
      creation. \u2018God no longer exist\u2019 believes that either we have killed
      God or it no longer exist in this world.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Mind Fixation and The Destruction of Substance '
    content: "The primary goal of Social Capitalism is to liberate the workforce
      and delegate manual labor to machinery. This somewhat ties to a concept that
      is originated from another disciplinary subject: Mind Fixation. The liberation
      of mind from trivial things is essential to liberate the workforce. It is to
      make one\u2019s mind to focus on greater things rather than menial and obsolete
      things.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of shifting focus of one\u2019s mind from real
      things to less tangible thing can be varied. In modern era, we are shifting
      our work from doing manual labor (manufacturing things, farming, fishing) to
      nonphysical work (content creation, investor, software developer). With it
      our mind becoming increasingly unable to grasp \u2018trivial things\u2019 like
      most people these days were unable to feel what it\u2019s like to be in starvation
      for an extended period of time. While it is possible to be in starvation at
      any time, it is nearly impossible to be starve for maybe 1 month or more due
      to the epoch we are living in. The consequence is that the philosophical, story
      and moral ethics born out of a person living in starvation will be lost. The
      substance will be gone. \r\n\r\nThen there is a problem of why people in undeveloped
      countries cannot comprehend progressivism or sexual movements? This is because
      their mind hasn\u2019t been liberated, stuck in conservative, status quo culture.
      Their consciousness has not been realized yet, they are in \u2018lower-level\u2019
      of consciousness. They haven\u2019t reached the point of being conscious or
      attempt to \u2018role-play\u2019 or empathize with those people. They most
      likely, being led to false consciousness where their mind has been fixated
      on the wrong things. With it, information and their ontology of the world has
      not matured yet, echo chamber narrowing their view of world. \r\n\r\nAnother
      consequence is by doing replacement of our mind fixation with other things
      is the enablement of the state of forgetness, for example: our behavior with
      other people. When in a state of forgetness or an \u2018NPC mode\u2019, we
      do na\xEFve approach to a person. In that state, we do not mind the emotion
      of the people in such depth, it did not analyze other people\u2019s consciousness
      deeply. We are doing some kind of reductionist approach where we crush a person
      which are supposedly complex and has a long history of life to be reduced to
      a stereotype/an oversimplified identity.\r\n\r\nAn example during modern-day
      peacetime: the longer it lasts, the more people diverge and converges. Everyone\u2019s
      ego will be increasingly diverging and every identity of a man will become
      widely different over time. In this era, people will become increasingly isolated,
      less communitarian, disoriented and disjointed with the world, everyone will
      be living in their own island. They will all find the world cruel and complicated.
      However, during war time, complex system collapsed. Society becomes conformist,
      individual\u2019s identity will be crushed and everyone will be similar & relatable.
      \r\n\r\n\u201CDuring peace, everyone was minding their own business. In a way
      they went into a state of forgetness, repressing one\u2019s potentially of
      higher-level of consciousness; they have been embroiled in false consciousness.
      In here, I felt anxiety the most and, in a world, full of people that are disillusioned
      with reality.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut in the most unexpected way, in war, I
      find peace and love of the people returned back. Their mind no longer fixated
      on trivial, intangible things, now they have their mind fixated on the life
      of their own and their own kind. When you strip people from materialism, they
      started to contemplate on themselves. They have been liberated from the enslavement
      of materialism.\u201D\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Timekeeper Existence '
    content: "The mechanism of Timekeeper and how it works never fully understood,
      many believe it was simply an error in the universe that all Timekeepers simply
      fully accepts. The study of Timekeeper works never mattered; it is perhaps
      a being that was thrown in to the world by God to see the effect of how much
      chaos will be inflicted if one could bring a forbidden knowledge from the future.\r\n\r\nIt
      is impossible to prove the existence of Timekeepers to mass society and only
      \u2018blind faith\u2019 of a man or telling one the right order of information
      can turn someone to believe the existence of a Timekeeper. Non-Timekeepers
      who didn\u2019t believe Timekeepers existed were obviously could not be convinced
      with literal and direct information instead the Timekeepers must construct
      a narrative to convince one. As the Timekeepers themselves are an entity not
      entangled to space and time.\r\n\r\nTimekeepers are basically emancipated from
      death. The limitation of time is now rendered obsolete. A man no longer fears
      of missing out. Identity change per death allowed a man to absorb a \u2018forbidden
      knowledge\u2019, to see what is it like to be other people.\r\n\r\nIn modern
      complex society, this become increasingly prevalent. With identities increases
      converges under the powerful economy of social-capitalism, many people feared
      the inability to experience many things. Timekeepers basically able to wear
      the mask of many identities, no longer it fears that it cannot experience to
      become \u2018other people\u2019. It is like trying role-playing every class/role
      in an RPG game.\r\n\r\nA modern Timekeeper will be able to mold the many types
      of identities: a doctor, a radical, a girl, a boy, a celebrity or any identity.
      As a consequence of these identity changes, it gains knowledge previously missed
      in other identity; a Timekeeper will grow to become a rigorous critical theorist
      and develop perspective of the many. Learning holistically from all major social
      science like: psychology, history to economics & game theory, all will be essential
      in understanding a society in its totality. And in conjunction with its ability
      to order a set of information to a more coherent narrative, a Timekeeper can
      see pattern and view the world with from \u2018God-like\u2019 perspective.\r\n"
