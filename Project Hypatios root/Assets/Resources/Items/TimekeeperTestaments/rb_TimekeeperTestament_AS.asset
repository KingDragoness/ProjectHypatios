    content: "As of 2060, Earth is still under heavy Sixtusian influence. Since the
      fall of the Kaiser, many Sixtus occupied territories (protectorates, colonies,
      military administration) on Earth had been released, some to the status of
      satellite state and others totally independent but overwhelming of them are
      under Sixtusian economic dominance.\r\n\r\nThe MENA region (Middle-east north
      Africa) has been utterly devastated even to this day when both the Sixtusian
      Empire and the United Nations invaded and overthrow the Caliphate State during
      War of the Universe. The former countries of Gulf States, Yemen, Jordan, Syria,
      Lebanon, Sinai region and Israel was still under Sixtusian Outerboundary administration
      as \u201CSixtus Arabia States\u201D. Almost all Jews in Israel had been expulsed
      from their own country since the Caliphate invaded Israel in 2032 and they
      either immigrates to Sixtus Core or Europe, not returning since the expulsion.
      To prevent any conflicts in the future, in 2037, SAS (Sixtus Arabia States)
      administration controversially decided to remove Israel, nullify the \u2018holy
      land\u2019 claim and replace it with State of Palestine.\r\n\r\nEast Asia becomes
      the wealthiest region on Earth, with China being the largest economy in the
      world with GDP of \xA260.2 trillion and per capita of \xA246,000. This was
      then followed by India with GDP of \xA228.35 trillion and per capita of \xA217,000.\r\n\r\nOriginally,
      while Sixtus introduced nuclear energy which nullifies the use of oil in transportation
      and energy sector, Sixtus imported many oils to manufacture plastic from Central
      Asia and Middle East. This all changes when War of the Universe ended with
      the Sixtusian Empire had open access to the United Dionary Empire\u2019s massive
      natural gas and crude oil reserves which totally destroyed all of oil-based
      economy on Earth. Mobius Corps\u2019 petrochemical division in UDE are responsible
      for 40% of the production of all plastics and oil extraction in the empire.
      An infamous quote from Kaiser when the Sixtusian Empire first arrived on Earth
      in 2016:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen the humans asked what we want, I answered: Oil.\u201D\r\n\r\nUnited
      Kingdom, United States and many countries that relies on financial sector has
      been totally squashed by the arrival of the Sixtusian Empire.\r\n\r\nThe economic
      situation in 2060:\r\n\u2022\tSixtus Arabia States and MENA: poorest region
      on Earth. Its average GDP per capita are around \xA22,100.\r\n\u2022\tWestern
      and Central Africa: \xA22,800.\r\n\u2022\tSouthern Africa and non-EAF East
      Africa countries: \xA23,600.\r\n\u2022\tCentral Asia: \xA24,000.\r\n\u2022\tCentral
      & South America: \xA25,300.\r\n\u2022\tSouth-East Asia: \xA212,000.\r\n\u2022\tEast
      Africa Federation: \xA213,000.\r\n\u2022\tSouth Asia: \xA216,000.\r\n\u2022\tNorth
      America: \xA226,000.\r\n\u2022\tAustralia and Oceania: \xA232,000.\r\n\u2022\tEurope:
      \xA238,000.\r\n\u2022\tEast Asia: \xA245,000.\r\n\r\n"
