  - chapterName: Earth Current Geopolitical Condition
    content: "As of 2060, Earth is still under heavy Sixtusian influence. Since the
      fall of the Kaiser, many Sixtus occupied territories (protectorates, colonies,
      military administration) on Earth had been released, some to the status of
      satellite state and others totally independent but overwhelming of them are
      under Sixtusian economic dominance.\r\n\r\nThe MENA region (Middle-east north
      Africa) has been utterly devastated even to this day when both the Sixtusian
      Empire and the United Nations invaded and overthrow the Caliphate State during
      War of the Universe. The former countries of Gulf States, Yemen, Jordan, Syria,
      Lebanon, Sinai region and Israel was still under Sixtusian Outerboundary administration
      as \u201CSixtus Arabia States\u201D. Almost all Jews in Israel had been expulsed
      from their own country since the Caliphate invaded Israel in 2032 and they
      either immigrates to Sixtus Core or Europe, not returning since the expulsion.
      To prevent any conflicts in the future, in 2037, SAS (Sixtus Arabia States)
      administration controversially decided to remove Israel, nullify the \u2018holy
      land\u2019 claim and replace it with State of Palestine.\r\n\r\nEast Asia becomes
      the wealthiest region on Earth, with China being the largest economy in the
      world with GDP of \xA260.2 trillion and per capita of \xA246,000. This was
      then followed by India with GDP of \xA228.35 trillion and per capita of \xA217,000.\r\n\r\nOriginally,
      while Sixtus introduced nuclear energy which nullifies the use of oil in transportation
      and energy sector, Sixtus imported many oils to manufacture plastic from Central
      Asia and Middle East. This all changes when War of the Universe ended with
      the Sixtusian Empire had open access to the United Dionary Empire\u2019s massive
      natural gas and crude oil reserves which totally destroyed all of oil-based
      economy on Earth. Mobius Corps\u2019 petrochemical division in UDE are responsible
      for 40% of the production of all plastics and oil extraction in the empire.
      An infamous quote from Kaiser when the Sixtusian Empire first arrived on Earth
      in 2016:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen the humans asked what we want, I answered: Oil.\u201D\r\n\r\nBritain,
      United States and many countries that relies on financial sector has been totally
      squashed by the arrival of the Sixtusian Empire.\r\n\r\nThe economic situation
      in 2060:\r\n\u2022\tSixtus Arabia States and MENA: poorest region on Earth.
      Its average GDP per capita are around \xA22,100.\r\n\u2022\tWestern and Central
      Africa: \xA22,800.\r\n\u2022\tSouthern Africa and non-EAF East Africa countries:
      \xA23,600.\r\n\u2022\tCentral Asia: \xA24,000.\r\n\u2022\tCentral & South America:
      \xA25,300.\r\n\u2022\tSouth-East Asia: \xA212,000.\r\n\u2022\tEast Africa Federation:
      \xA213,000.\r\n\u2022\tSouth Asia: \xA216,000.\r\n\u2022\tNorth America: \xA226,000.\r\n\u2022\tAustralia
      and Oceania: \xA232,000.\r\n\u2022\tEurope: \xA238,000.\r\n\u2022\tEast Asia:
      \xA245,000.\r\n\r\nEuropean political situation isn\u2019t exactly stable following
      War of the Universe. The increasingly unpopular monarch and growing power of
      the republicans supported by the Sixtusian Empire caused 2047 British Revolution
      which overthrows the British monarchy and replaced it with a social-capitalist
      government becoming Republic of Great Britain. Britain was then expelled from
      the commonwealth realm, joined numerous social-capitalist international organizations
      while Australia becomes the main country of the commonwealth realm.\r\n\r\nWestern
      Europe (including Spain, Portugal and Italy) was amongst the most unchanged
      region following Sixtusian arrival on Earth. Strong real economy of Western
      Europe that was not service sector made it able to survive Sixtusian\u2019
      economic dominance on Earth. Despite UDE bombardment and failed invasion attempt
      of Europe, Europe was recovering relatively quickly and its economy still head
      strong to the present day. There were still numerous political changes however,
      France and Germany are now ruled by a social-capitalist party for at least
      10 cumulative years since War of the Universe. \r\n\r\nCentral & Eastern Europe
      destruction caused by UDE was more severe although Poland, Czech, Slovakia
      and the Baltic States returned to status quo and lack any significant changes.
      In south-eastern Europe however, there were major changes with the return of
      Yugoslavia of all former Yugoslavia states with now Bulgaria entered the Federal
      Union of Yugoslavia. It was formed due to political fears caused by the Caliphate
      failed invasion of south-east Europe during War of the Universe. Greece, Albania,
      Cyprus and Turkiye were effectively nearly destroyed by the Caliphate and returned
      to the status quo after the war. \r\n\r\nUnited States didn\u2019t join any
      battle or wars but it suffers from gradual economic downturn and political
      violence & unrest. United States became a hotbed for white supremacist extremism
      and southern ultra-nationalist. The 2049 American Insurrection caused a major
      destabilization for the United States where the Conservative Brotherhood Alliance
      launched a failed violent coup d\u2019etat attempt with over 100k right wing
      militias takes arms to overthrow the government. The Confederate State of the
      South was successfully formed in 2051 with South Florida as the first state
      to entered the confederation. Since then, the rest of Florida, entire of Georgia
      and southern part of Alabama joined by 2060. There were Social-capitalist revolutionaries
      attempts to seize major cities by establishing a social-capitalist republic.

  - chapterName: "Human\u2019s Reaction to the Outer World "
    content: "If humans in the past saw the Sixtusian Empire, the state of the universe,
      the existence of multiple lifeforms, Warp Gates and Elder Races could easily
      see it as madness and an absolute delusion; all of their history almost laid
      to waste and retrospectively, made human\u2019s history insignificant. The
      world of today might seen as an absolute insanity, religions of Earth had been
      shaken, God\u2019s existence is questioned, Human\u2019s version of physics
      and science has been revised to keep on track with Sixtusian version. The once
      oblivious human which developed its own ways now its epoch and history has
      finally merged together with the rest of the galaxy.\r\n\r\nFor Kaiser, this
      is a gaslighting similar to how the Europeans colonized the world in the 19th
      and 20th century when rewrite the world or at least, the perception of the
      world from the eurocentrist view. The Sixtusian Empire essentially like that,
      it was retroactively undermining human\u2019s history and its accomplishment,
      it was the preservation of native\u2019s culture yet the treatment is more
      like obsolete, \u2018exoticism\u2019 cultural thing rather than consensus universality
      like science.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Salafism and the Caliphate '
    content: "Simply known only as \u201CThe Caliphate\u201D, the Caliphate was once
      the largest country on Earth before its collapse in 2035. The government type
      is a Caliphate Republic. The Caliphate power was all centralized on Pahliv
      Aul Said who held the title of Caliph or the Supreme Leader, his word becomes
      the highest law. The Caliphate was planned to be a democratic Caliphate republic
      once Pahliv dies or resigns. Its ideology is Islamofascism, pan-Islamism, anti-Salafism,
      Islamic modernism, Neo-Baathism, anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism and pan-Arabism.
      Pahliv staunchly rejected orthodox Islam and instead supporting syncretic form
      of it which he supports bi\u2019dah, taking elements from other cultures and
      abandoning \u2018obsolete\u2019 Islamic values. Pahliv denounced Salafism and
      orthodox Islam as \u2018degenerate backward vanguardist\u2019, he denounced
      the Arab monarchs of petrol states as hypocrite, anti-democratic and traitor
      to the Muslims. He claimed:\r\n\r\n\u201COur brother had been oppressed under
      the capitalism for long. Salafism and orthodox Islam supporters chanted the
      total enforcement Sharia laws without appropriation of the people. Sunnah is
      absolute! They spoke. They suppressed the intellectualism of the Muslim, the
      capitalists and imperialists had successfully tear us apart in order to profiteer
      themselves! We had every chance to unite under one state but those dogs give
      Ferrari, skyscrapers, Lamborghini and Louis Vuitton to these Sultan, emirs
      to suppress us, to corrupt our minds and destruction of the intellectuals in
      exchange for resources! Our people become workers, coolie not intellects! We
      must have the consciousness to attack against these wretched dogs who have
      tear us apart! All of our Muslim brothers must feel safe no matter where they
      go and unite under one religion, one Caliphate, one state! God is the greatest!\u201D\r\n\r\nFollowing
      a popular uprising, the Caliphate was formed and overthrow the governments
      of the gulf states in 2027, many of orthodox Islamist in the Saudi Arabia were
      purged, prisoned, killed or exiled.\r\n\r\nIt established itself as a revolutionary
      Caliphate to crush capitalism, restore the glory of the Caliphate era and restoring
      the golden era intellectualism by embracing science and technologies. Pahliv
      seek out for \u2018reformation\u2019 of Islam; he justified the reformation
      and bi\u2019dah to confront against the Sixtusian Empire who threatened not
      only their religion but also the entire human race as its history going to
      be rewritten. Gaining significant political power, Pahliv enacted unprecedented
      progressive reforms however he antagonized other religions particularly due
      to how the West, China and Russia bows to the Sixtusian Empire after the Sixtusian
      had devastated Earth with its pathogens and later invaded Congo, North Korea,
      Venezuela, Mexico and other countries either for being a \u2018failed state\u2019
      or close their economy.\r\n\r\nPahliv\u2019s progressive reforms, crush of
      the orthodox Islam, crush of the corrupt Arab monarch and strong anti-Sixtusian
      stance made him extremely popular in the Muslim world and even other parts
      of the world. Despite a Sunni, Pahliv declared the Caliphate would be tolerant
      to Shia and issued fatwa to all Sunni to nullify all animosity towards Shia,
      however he declared non-Muslim as kafir and aggressively pursue for dakwah
      for the entirety of humanity. The United Nations and Sixtusian government were
      quite disturbed by the Caliphate fatwa\u2019s of ramping up hostility of \u2018non-believers\u2019.
      Pahliv declared the famous tagline:\r\n\r\n\u201CEvery Muslim in the world
      must feel safe no matter where they are in the world.\u201D\r\n\r\nKaiser mocked
      the Pahliv\u2019s quote directly taken Hitler\u2019s \u2018Every German around
      the world must feel safe\u2019. According to Kaiser, Pahliv ideology is technically
      Islamofascism, in that it seeks to convert or eliminate anything that is not
      of their kind and attempting to establishing a totalitarian Caliphate Jihadist
      state.\r\n\r\nIn Pahliv speeches, he vows to drive the Sixtusian Empire out
      from Earth. His greatest fear is that the Sixtusian Empire will undoubtly overwrite
      the cultures and religions of Earth, launching a cultural genocide and turning
      humans into an empty soul, its history overwritten. The submission of the United
      Nations towards the Sixtusian Empire has caused Pahliv greatly questioned Earth\u2019s
      sovereignty and how in just the span of around 10 years, humans becomes Sixtusian\u2019
      puppet.\r\n\r\nThe Caliphate upon took over, it retains Sixtusian factories
      and no trade embargo imposed however relations are hostile and ideologically
      contradicts with each other. It navigates itself carefully and avoids any provocation
      with the Empire until Citadel betrayed Pahliv in 2033 which he initiated invasion
      on all directions out of desperation. At its apex, the Caliphate spanned contiguously:
      entirety Maghreb in Africa; Andalusia Spain & Italian Sicily island in Western
      Europe; Serbia, Montenegro & lower Romania in South-eastern Europe; and to
      the furthest in east direction of Xinjiang region in China.\r\n\r\nStates under
      Caliphate:\r\n-\tThe gulf states, Levant, Iraq, Egypt, Cyprus were under direct
      Caliphate rule.\r\n-\tIran, Pakistan and Afghanistan as \u2018client state
      of Caliphate\u2019.\r\n-\tTurkey, part of India, Bangladesh as \u2018vassal
      state\u2019.\r\n-\tMaghreb regions as \u2018protectorate state\u2019.\r\n"
