  - chapterName: Uberwelt/Superculture
    content: "Uberwelt or Superior Culture, is one the central tenet of Kaiser\u2019s
      imperialism ideology. Uberwelt means superior culture, according to Kaiser
      interpretation, Uberwelt meant the ability to assimilate all culture, adopt
      universally accepted values and turn it into one big giant culture. Examples
      of superculture are the Han Chinese culture, Islamic culture, Hindu culture
      and Latin America culture. The cultures mentioned above, are spanning across
      multiple continents, ethnic and races. Kaiser realized if that his legacy and
      Sixtusian\u2019 culture influence to endured a long time, he needed to establish
      a new superculture.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kaiser, revolutionary and instant cultural
      destruction will only result in a backlash. Instead, it must dominate all countries
      economically and politically, then through the 100 years process, slowly replace
      the inferior cultures. The points out how indigenous tribes can be turned to
      Christianity due to uberwelt of the European.\r\n\r\nKaiser saw American culture
      as a total failure. He noted the following:\r\n\r\n\u201CYou see America has
      a rich, different cultures adopted by different people. These different cultures,
      are to be said by na\xEFve people that many \u2018colors\u2019 are beautiful.
      To have many types of people living with different ways of life and culture
      will make our life interesting. But I saw (this) as an absolute unsustainability.
      Cultures of left, right, socialists, capitalists, the young people, libtards
      and boomers clashed together. People in America or non-homogenous cultures
      state lived in their own bubble, only interacting with other for economic,
      societal or political purpose, a contrast to Islamic or homogenous Asian countries
      where they established an uberwelt and in a way, had stronger communitarian
      values. A society with different cultures will result in an inevitable clash
      and riots, the only reason stopping people from clashing is the economy or
      the current establishment is strong (enough) to successfully distract them
      from murdering each other. Once capitalism isn\u2019t working, socialism becomes
      the norm, scientific innovation is reaching its limits and the world is reaching
      stagnation, then the uberwelt will become the norm. Different cultures acceptance
      as espoused by the idiot na\xEFve \u2018progressive left\u2019 is not sustainability,
      it must launch \u2018cultural genocide\u2019 against inferior cultures then
      create one universal homogeneous culture for all to adopt.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever,
      it was noted that the American culture did succeed both in the 19th and 20th
      century. Many of western cultures were adopted widespread and was in absolute
      power during those two centuries. But when the Sixtusian Empire arrived, Earth\u2019s
      universalist/pop culture was beginning to be replaced by Sixtusian culture.
      Sixtusian pop culture was already the strongest in Safar for 70 years before
      Sixtusian Empire\u2019s arrival on Earth in 2016 with the Sixtusian had the
      most robust entertainment, music, video game and fashion industry.\r\n\r\nAn
      example to explain why the Sixtusian is superculture is the polygamic society
      system. Sixtus starting to breaks down the wife-father family dynamics in the
      1960s and began replacing it with a dynamic polygamic relationship system with
      applies to both polyandry and polygyny. With the combination being the most
      liberal and most LGBT state in Safar, Sixtus becomes a totally progressive
      society, traditional family relationship in 2010 only constitutes 15%, while
      73% claim of polygamy. A family can have a few children and rather than two
      parents to take care the children, this new flexibility allows for 3,4,5 or
      more parents to take care one child interchangeability. The Kaiser likened
      accepted these progressive family values and endorsed it since 2000s since
      with this new movement, it breaks the artificial boundaries of families and
      egoism which allows flexibility; liberate the workforce to contribute the national
      effort for Kaiser\u2019s future wars and industrial might.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Critic against the USA"
    content: "Kaiser vehemently against United States\u2019 absolute support of freedom
      and free speech. Kaiser remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CUnited States\u2019 support
      of democracy and free speech is hypocritical at its core. Freedom of speech
      and rights are in itself limited, an anecdote is that you are given a small
      plot of land and free to do anything with but outside of the boundary, there
      are limitation. It is simply an illusion. However, the biggest problem is that
      United States\u2019 ideology directly contradicts with its execution where
      the American government is powerful and asserts dominance against other poorer
      countries to make stuffs for the United States so that American civilians will
      be liberated from the workforce and be \u2018free\u2019. This is a paradox.
      The ideology contradict itself. The only ideology that is valid is social-capitalism,
      a balanced communitarianism and individualism, basically a balance of not being
      too anarchist so there will be order and not too authoritarian so a little
      chaos can bring innovation.\u201D\r\n\r\nKaiser had absolute faith with Sixtusian
      main ideology, social-capitalism. The capitalistic, laissez-fairez nature of
      the United States is argued to be problematic due to inability to initiate
      large projects or mobilize its population. Sixtus notably shifted heavily towards
      the left under Kaiser\u2019s rule in order to quickly mobilize its population
      for space colonization and wage war against the Alpha, Elistar and United Dionary
      Empire.\r\n\r\n"
