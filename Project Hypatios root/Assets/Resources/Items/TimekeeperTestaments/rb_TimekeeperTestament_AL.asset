  - chapterName: 'Sixtusian Economy under the Kaiser '
    content: "Kaiser\u2019s economic goals during his early years is to obliterate
      the service sector which had 60% of its GDP, reindustrialization, nationalization
      and turn from liberal free market to state capitalist market dirigisme economy.
      The deliberalization of Sixtusian economy are aimed so that the Kaiser had
      a grip on power. Kaiser\u2019s invasion of tax-haven state to obliteration
      has effectively rendered offshore tax haven obsolete. Money in circulation
      all moved to more productive investment of the extraterrestrial industry. Government\u2019s
      aggressive planetary colonization and rapid construction of space colonies
      enabled commodity explosion and massively increased Sixtusian\u2019 manufacturing
      capability. By 2030, virtually all metal and rare-metals price on average dropped
      to 1/20 of the 2016 price, energy per capita is 180,000 kWh per person per
      year compared to 22,000 kWh in 2016.\r\n\r\nRapid shift to leftist economic
      policy meant the seizure of important industries that were on strategic national
      interest: mining, food, military and aerospace industries. Kaiser deprioritize
      some part of the economy in order to divert resources to more productive parts:
      the automotive industries (high-end cars), consumer electronics, food, shipbuilding
      and the entertainment industry, all of the mentioned sector are dropping in
      terms of share of the total GDP. The shift from consumer to hard industries
      has caused mass layoffs and dislocate over 22 million Sixtusians from 2016
      to 2020, a whopping 21% of the entire workforce. Space transportation and space
      colonies quickly becomes one of the major workforces, extraterrestrial civil
      engineers and spaceship engineer becomes one of the most essential workforce
      that highly contributed to the empire\u2019s rise. \r\n\r\nBefore the rise
      of Kaiser in 2016, economy of Sixtus from 1980s to 2016 was dominated by the
      service sector, accounted 60% of the GDP by 2016. Following Sixtus rapid space
      colonization, the Sixtus\u2019 economy restructured towards reindustrialization:
      inequality greatly increases and the manufacturing & mining industry overtakes
      the service sector. Kaiser\u2019s regime launched reforms to overhaul the financial
      system for the reindustrialization effort. \r\n\r\nTax collection of the lower
      class was effectively eliminated, utility costs were totally eliminated only
      the up-front utility fee needed and foods were subsidized. These perks were
      only applied to \u2018full citizen\u2019 of the empire which has completed
      education and the conscription/social service. Several financial instruments
      that were changed, removed or added during Kaiser rule are the following: banning
      of cryptocurrencies, consolidate dozens of major banks to just 4 banks, deflationary
      currency, limiting circulation of M1, M2, M3 money supply while rapidly increase
      M0 money supply and implementation of war bonds during War of the Universe
      and Sixtusian-Alphanian War.\r\n\r\nThe first half of Kaiser\u2019s regime
      was famous for its deflationary currency. Under his rule, Sixtus deliberately
      limited its printing of the money supply meanwhile massive commodity boom,
      productivity increases and Sixtus\u2019 aggressive imperialist policy of expansionism
      caused deflation. The amount of goods rapidly becomes available and price of
      raw materials are collapsing. The rapid technological advancement from adopting
      Dionarian, Elven and Titan race ensures companies will inevitably spend money
      to invest on new technology, fear of getting obsolete or getting behind.\r\n\r\nKaiser
      was notably staunchly defensive in pursuing deflationary policy rather than
      inflationary. As said above, the rapid technological changes and partial war
      economy during Kaiser\u2019 rule forces people to spend money immediately rather
      than later, preventing money hoarding. Then private investors were utterly
      destroyed by Kaiser\u2019s nationalization and dirigisme, combined with government\u2019s
      constant stimulation of market\u2019s demands and strict control of the economy,
      this prevents deflationary spiral. \r\n\r\nKaiser\u2019s Sixtus was stringent
      to print money to match with the falling goods and services prices to induce
      inflation. Kaiser feared that by attempting to stabilizing the price of goods,
      it will not be fast enough to entice corporations to innovate and build up
      its factories.\r\n\r\nKaiser remarked regarding currency:\r\n\r\n\u201CA circulating
      money is like land value. Imagine you distribute 100,000 m2 of land to some
      people. Treat it like 1 m2 is 1 Centurion. Say if the people of a country,
      let\u2019s call it Retonia develop its land only like farms, barns then every
      Centurion of Retonia will be low, you cannot do much other than buy food from
      those barns. But if a country of, called it Silesia has a hotel, barbershop,
      factory, then every Centurion of Silesia will be high. You can buy goods from
      factories, rent a hotel or get a haircut. Silesia \xA2100,000 is worth more
      than Retonia \xA2100,000. This is what I pursue with our currency. With every
      Centurion you have, you must be able to buy as much as possible.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CExcept
      the things that were interfering with strategic interest. That\u2019s when
      we raise the price of it high.\u201D\r\n\r\nSixtusian Centurion deflation meant
      its value increases ~5% per year. An attractive guaranteed return caused many
      people from all over the galaxy rapidly traded their homeworld currency with
      Sixtusian Centurion, this quickly destroyed the foreign reserves from Earth
      and Cassantor, not to mention, investing in Sixtusian corporations that are
      rising rapidly brings insane amount of return. Alpha, UDE and Elistar Empire
      despite launched a near total embargo against Sixtus, the Sixtusian Empire
      manufacture Dionarian, Titan and Elven goods then sold it to their black market,
      crippling their consumer goods industry. This caused rapid adoption of the
      Sixtusian currency from 2% of the galaxy in 2016 to 60% by 2030. \r\n\r\nSixtusian
      deflationary trend ended in 2036 after War of the Universe which the central
      Sixtusian bank finally rapidly increases its money supply in an attempt to
      redistribute more wealth to private entities and investors. With it, Sixtusian
      currency returned to inflationary state to this day.\r\n\r\nMajority of the
      empire\u2019s income are coming from taxing the megacorporations, upper class
      and state-owned enterprises. Sixtusian biggest revenue SOE are in its mining,
      hard commodity production and construction industry, with this, the Sixtusian
      government had total dominance in producing intermediate goods of the hard
      commodity market. Due to Sixtusian economic dominance, most of private manufacturing
      companies that relies on metal or chemical goods buys commodities directly
      from the Sixtusian SOEs, this system makes the Sixtusian Empire had absolute
      monopoly on the commodity market.\r\n\r\nKaiser and the Totalitarian Party
      implemented circulation containment which is an economic theory that states:
      in three-sector model of primary (material), secondary (manufacturing) and
      tertiary (service), the money circulation must be ordered from the largest
      (material) to the smallest (service sector). If the money circulating in service
      sector is bigger than the primary and secondary combined, then it will threaten
      national interest and greatly increases the risk of financial instability.
      Kaiser believes giving money/power to the investor/capitalist class would only
      invest on things that were giving returns in the short term; neglecting any
      long-term national development. Attempt to arrange the pyramid in the wrong
      order or de-industrialize meant destroying domestic industrial capability.
      Kaiser\u2019s quote regarding government:\r\n\r\n\u201CGovernment is useless
      until you need them.\u201D\r\n\r\nOne of Kaiser\u2019s major fears of not controlling
      certain industry is that it will dig a quite deep hole. An example is the food
      industry, according to the Kaiser, if the food industry is uncontrolled then
      it will produce sodas, fast food or junk foods. Unchecked production of junk
      foods will cause financial cost in healthcare and slowed mobilization of the
      population, making people fat unnecessarily creates debilitating diseases and
      according to Kaiser: \u201CWorst version of ourselves\u201D. For this reason,
      availability of food in Sixtus was tightly controlled, this is to prevent the
      cost to fall too low and able to dictate populace\u2019s diet. In terms of
      executing it, Kaiser knows he could not outright stop the flow of it but rather,
      he deliberately makes the logistics of \u2018fast foods\u2019 or illegal unhealthy
      food to become unsustainable or very pricey while subsidies provided by the
      government are affordable, even free which in addition to that: healthy and
      its intake has been measured & curated by experts.\r\n\r\nHealthcare was tightly
      controlled to the government too. Private hospitals were nationalized and the
      government can roughly allocate the right number of doctors to better suit
      the data. Since doctors, physicians schooled for a lengthy amount of time,
      this needs government who in conjunction dictate the populace\u2019s food through
      food subsidies, can establish long term sustainable planning to better predict
      what\u2019s the economy of healthcare be like, for example: elimination of
      fast foods reduce the need for cardiovascular doctors. By controlling multiple
      industries like food and healthcare, it can remove unnecessary economic activities
      simply by preventing obesity or other health issues. Healthcare policies of
      Kaiser focuses heavily on the young particularly below the age of 45, most
      spending for the elderly were relatively decreased while young healthcare increased,
      with the mental healthcare and social programs to prevent social isolation
      were given a top priority by Kaiser. Social programs were radical in that it
      is in the form of military conscription for most people or mandatory community
      service intended to remove unemployment, social isolation and/or helping building
      up a civilian\u2019s work ethics.\r\n\r\nMining and heavy industry manufacturing
      became the largest contributor to Sixtusian GDP: Around 53%. Mining companies
      were totally nationalized while heavy industry manufacturing companies were
      dominated by private entities. As said, many of Sixtusian government revenue
      comes from mining SOEs, selling commodities to Sixtusian manufacturing companies
      or exporting to other nations. Due to Sixtusian dominance of the metal commodity
      market, they were able to set prices which served to protect Sixtus\u2019 national
      interest. For instance, the government raise the tariff of metal for the UDE
      and later banned it during the war. At its peak, the Sixtusian Outerboundary
      controls 96% of all production and extraction of metals in the galaxy.\r\n\r\nKaiser
      heavily improved Sixtusian national infrastructure. Many highways, railways,
      utility, energy, transport infrastructure and housing were constructed. This
      caused a construction boom and the result is increased Sixtusian economic productivity
      and industrial base. Sixtusian construction companies like Mixtec then specializing
      on constructing modular structures on space and outer colonies. Many of Sixtusian
      construction company were effectively nationalized following Kaiser\u2019s
      rise to power. Space bases and outpost were constructed en masse to support
      the mining operation on space colonies. Construction was heavily funded by
      Sixtusian government. Kaiser intention of rapid imperialist conquest meant
      construction of new outpost and building spaceships for logistics is important.\r\n\r\nThe
      Sixtusian Empire has effectively turned itself into an export-oriented economy,
      exporting goods to every race in the galaxy. This is a stark contrast compared
      to UDE, Elistar and Alpha Empire who were dominant in the galaxy but closed
      their economies due to their feudalist societal system. With this gap, the
      Sixtusian rapidly dominates by fulfilling the market of many races in the galaxy,
      transforming it into an economic superpower of the galaxy. The closed economy
      of UDE and Elistar was forced to be broken down by a treaty in War of the Universe
      which enforced zero-restriction on trade barriers, banned trade embargoes and
      zero-restriction of Sixtusian corporations to build up factories in UDE territories.
      The embargo ban treaty was signed to last for 60 years which will ended in
      2096.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Citadel\u2019s Regime Economy "
    content: "Rise of Kingdom Citadel and the Coalition of the Timekeepers shifted
      from state capitalist dirigisme economy to a neoliberal market economy. Citadel
      continues the policies of trickling-down economy to an extreme level: the bottom
      98% possess 10% of the nation\u2019s wealth while the top 2% possess 90% of
      the country\u2019s wealth. Coalition of Timekeepers exploited the stock market
      and insider knowledge to gain money which almost all of them becoming billionaires
      or powerful officials.\r\n\r\nCitadel\u2019s regime hallmark is rampant corruption,
      weakening state institution and the rise of megacorporations. The most notable
      difference between Citadel\u2019s regime and Kaiser\u2019s regime:\r\n-\tNon-existence
      labor union with terrible worker\u2019s rights protection. Workers\u2019 rights
      were neglected.\r\n-\tTaxes are increased for value-added tax and reintroduced
      tax income for the lower and the middle class while corporate taxes were reduced.\r\n-\tCapitalists
      and investors reigned free under Citadel. With the economy gearing towards
      service sector and deindustrialization; off-shoring many industries to other
      countries including Earth, UDE, Titan and Cassantor.\r\n-\tEconomic sector
      currently shifting towards the service sector; entertainment industry and consumer
      goods industry were rising rapidly. Deindustrialization in Sixtus Core while
      offshoring manufacturing to Earth, Cassantor and the UDE. \r\n\r\nIn 2053,
      9 years after Kaiser\u2019s fall, was utterly furious with Citadel\u2019s policies
      and remarked the following:\r\n\r\n\u201CCitadel is a traitor to the Social-Capitalist
      cause and deserve to be shot. He is going to bring the country to a consumerist
      economy with unchecked production of consumer goods. When you rapidly raise
      people\u2019s living standard, it will add new factories, increasing inequality
      and the birth of \u2018bullshit jobs\u2019. No real productivity and then the
      resurrection of the status wealth industry with luxury cars, fashion brands
      made people became unconscious and delved to materialist world! With it, feudalism
      will return! Only by unchaining ourselves from the pegging of materialist things
      can we step one inch further to the true socialist state!\u201D\r\n\r\nDuring
      Kaiser\u2019s rule, the Sixtusian system had quite a lot of loopholes however
      Kaiser\u2019s totalitarian brutal grip on power meant corruption is negligible
      compared to the current Citadel\u2019s regime. Under the Kaiser, officials
      are regularly assessed and inspected which meant a well-documented that enabled
      to correctly assess one\u2019s wealth and merit. Those who were prioritized
      to be caught are those who are incompetent, inefficient and refused Kaiser\u2019s
      direct order. Competent, loyal, merit but corrupt officials are usually overlooked
      especially when the disadvantages of imprisoning that individual are too great.\r\n\r\nFollowing
      the fall of the Kaiser, Citadel\u2019s regime enabled a massive corruption
      environment for Sixtusian officials. Corruption was rampant, widespread and
      reached from the highest to lowest organs of the government. Regional government
      often commit embezzlement by stealing social funds and construction projects
      to enrich their families and relatives. In Kaiser\u2019s regime, officials
      almost never displayed their wealth publicly and constantly showed in their
      social media: their diligenceness, hard work and social interactivity with
      the common people. A stark contrast to Citadel\u2019s regime where officials
      flamboyantly displayed their wealth. \r\n\r\nCorruption in Kaiser\u2019s regime
      however, was often misused as a political instrument to overthrow a person
      out. In Citadel\u2019s regime, persecuted officials from corruption are rare
      as officials started to consolidate themselves together, establish a self-protecting
      interest circle, protecting each other and enriching together. With it, the
      officials and higher ups are all benefited from this collaborationist behavior
      this caused a substantial social and economic cost on Sixtusian general populace.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Income Disparity and Consumer Power '
    content: "\rThe average median of middle-class income of Sixtusian (80% of the
      population) is \u20AC80,000, meanwhile the top 0.5% has median income of \u20AC
      9.3 million. Sixtus has a massive income wealth gap. Despite the so-called
      elimination of tax for the lower class, the rich were significantly much richer
      than the middle class. This made the capitalists mustered significant leverage
      over the populace.\r\n\r\nThis is a deliberate decision by the Sixtusian government,
      distributing wealth to the masses is not in their agenda as they argued \u2018money
      is only a number\u2019 and the people of the lower class still able to access
      many goods very easily. They just built a powerful separation system between
      the capitalist and proletariats and giving a lot of power to Sixtusian corporations
      so these megacorporations\u2019 demands will be fulfilled easily. Most people
      could live off a year without working at all, some work only 5 days a week
      as they are able to fulfill all needs easily. Welfare programs and the fact
      people can live without work for a long time are direct consequences of Social-Capitalism,
      with this, the Sixtusian government was forced to disparate the income gap
      in order to give corporations more power. Kaiser\u2019s remarks:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
      very few capitalists and actual productive labor will fuel the economy of world
      while the rest of us can sleep and play games.\u201D\r\n\r\nOne of the most
      controversial Kaiser\u2019s economic policies is his restrictive development
      of the agricultural and food industry. Foods were 95% imported from Safarian
      countries with massive import tariff imposed of whopping 150% for most agricultural
      product. Kaiser\u2019s justification for the weak food industry can be simplified
      as: \u2018fat people are banned in the empire\u2019. He was a zealous, ardently
      executes programs to increase productivity labor output of the empire, which
      then he sees fat people as a major productivity destroyer of the empire. Kaiser
      nationalize all food industries, controls its supplies chain and implement
      large-scale food subsidies instead. Then the government-controlled food industries
      are obviously did not affected by the tariffs hence all surviving private food
      industries eventually collapsed and nationalized.\r\n\r\nDue to the ridiculous
      agriculture tariff, Sindom State becomes a major black market for illegally
      imported agriculture products due to its proximity to the border. The food
      industry being controlled by the state quickly becomes a hotbed for corruption.
      Some illegal market erected in non-Sindom states were downright impossible
      to survive due to Kaiser\u2019s strong enforcement of any illegal agriculture
      goods, only in Sindom state where border guards and law enforcement was unable
      to get rid of illegal markets.\r\n\r\nFor the Kaiser, it is absolutely ridiculous
      for an individual for pursue what\u2019s called \u2018financial freedom\u2019.
      If everyone is unemployed and unproductive then society and its economy will
      fall to its knees hence society\u2019s division between the worker class and
      the capitalists will forever exists.\r\n\r\nIn other case, border controls
      in Sixtus Republic have always been quite loose. From the incorporation of
      Kingsgard into Sixtusian Republic in 1933, Sixtusian geography is very vulnerable
      to illegal outsiders. The situation greatly exacerbated since 2025 with the
      influx of immigrants from Earth and Cassantor entering the Sixtus.\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Social-capitalism Ambiguity '
    content: "Social Capitalism has gained notoriety of its ambiguity and inconsistent
      ideology. Social-capitalism main goal is to delegate manual labor to the machinery
      and liberate the workforce to shift more manpower to higher, creative stuffs
      however there is a problem where by doing creative stuffs will lead to more
      manual labor. The shout of artisans of: \u2018commoditization\u2019 of art
      stuffs like painting is now becoming a commodity, a furnishing for someone\u2019s
      home hence bow down to the demands of mass society. The commoditization of
      goods meant automating art becomes the norm as it becomes a structure. When
      people highly value a good or service then its handcrafted-ness or the \u2018exoticism/cultural
      value\u2019 will always be manually work by labor even in the future. It is
      when the good becomes commoditized, when it loses its intrinsic value and becomes
      automate-able.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Cryptocurrency in Sixtusian Empire '
    content: "Cryptocurrency was banned under the Kaiser\u2019s rule. Kaiser\u2019s
      remarks on cryptocurrency:\r\n\r\n\u201CNo. Crypto cannot exist in the empire,
      it will screw up our money supply. Those cryptards (portmanteau of crypto and
      retards) can go fuck themselves.\u201D\r\n\r\nKingdom Citadel on questioned
      if cryptocurrency will return:\r\n\r\n\u201CFor this matter I vehemently agreed
      with Kaiser\u2019s words. We will be continuing Kaiser\u2019s policy banning
      of cryptocurrency.\u201D\r\n\r\nEarly Sixtusian crackdown of cryptocurrency
      is pretty intense even taking its matter by infiltrating illegal crypto exchange
      operations outside the empire, this caused liquidity of cryptocurrency pretty
      horrible and unsustainable however shortly rise of Citadel\u2019s regime, crypto
      was able to thrive again as Sixtus became much more relaxed in its foreign
      policies. However, when cryptocurrency reigned supreme in 2045 just a year
      after Kaiser\u2019s fall, it then became a thorn for the Sixtusian government
      again as it causes many illegal transactions in the black market. It then screws
      Sixtusian\u2019 monetary policies as capital flight to the cryptocurrency weakens
      the legitimacy of Sixtusian Centurion in international transactions.\r\n\r\nThe
      Sixtusian had enough and launched Operation Cryptard in the early of 2046 which
      aimed to destroy the confidence of the cryptocurrency by simply overflowing
      its money supply and have the government control all of the cryptocurrencies
      in the galaxy. The government-built thousands of supercomputers which able
      to control 70% of all crypto mining and then formed undercover agents to buy
      as much black-market goods as possible to obtain a lot of cryptocurrencies.
      The Sixtusian government then possess 70% of all cryptocurrencies which they
      had absolute control of the currencies and able to alternate the ledger and
      screws up the validation and consensus. By 2047, the market loses confidence
      with the cryptocurrency as the true valid ledger are distorted by Sixtusian
      government manipulated ledger. With this, the entire world of cryptocurrency
      collapses and it hasn\u2019t recovered since Operation Cryptard.\r\n"
