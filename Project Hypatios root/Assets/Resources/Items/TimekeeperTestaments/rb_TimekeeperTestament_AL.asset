    content: "The tax haven states were completely eliminated by 2020. Kaiser\u2019s
      invasion of tax-haven state to obliteration has effectively render offshore
      tax haven obsolete. Money in circulation all moved to more productive investment
      of the extraterrestrial industry. Government\u2019s aggressive planetary colonization
      and rapid construction of space colonies enabled commodity explosion and massively
      increased Sixtusian\u2019 manufacturing capability. By 2030, virtually all
      metal and rare-metals price on average dropped to 1/20 of the 2016 price, energy
      per capita is 180,000 kWh per person per year compared to 22,000 kWh in 2016.\r\n\r\nRapid
      shift to leftist economic policy meant the seizure of important industries
      that were on strategic national interest: mining, food, military and aerospace
      industries. Kaiser deprioritize some part of the economy in order to divert
      resources to more productive parts: the automotive industries (high-end cars),
      consumer electronics, food, shipbuilding and entertainment industry, all had
      its share of sector dropped. The shift from consumer to hard industries has
      caused mass layoffs and dislocate over 22 million Sixtusians from 2016 to 2020,
      a whopping 21% of the entire workforce. Space transportation and space colonies
      quickly becomes one of the major workforces, extraterrestrial civil engineers
      and spaceship engineer becomes one of the most essential workforce that highly
      contributed to the empire\u2019s rise. \r\n\r\nBefore the rise of Kaiser in
      2016, economy of Sixtus from 1980s to 2016 was dominated by the service sector,
      accounted 60% of the GDP by 2016. Following Sixtus rapid space colonization,
      the Sixtus\u2019 economy restructured towards reindustrialization: inequality
      greatly increases and the manufacturing & mining industry overtakes the service
      sector. Kaiser\u2019s regime launched reforms to overhaul the financial system
      for the reindustrialization effort. \r\n\r\nTax collection of the lower class
      was effectively eliminated, utility costs were totally eliminated only the
      up-front utility fee needed and foods were subsidized. These perks were only
      applied to \u2018full citizen\u2019 of the empire which has completed education
      and the conscription/social service. Several financial instruments that were
      changed, removed or added during Kaiser rule are the following: banning of
      cryptocurrencies, consolidate dozens of major banks to just 4 banks, deflationary
      currency, limiting circulation of M1, M2, M3 money supply while rapidly increase
      M0 money supply and implementation of war bonds during War of the Universe
      and Sixtusian-Alphanian War.\r\n\r\nKaiser\u2019s regime was famous for its
      deflationary currency. Under his rule, Sixtus deliberately limited its printing
      of the money supply meanwhile massive commodity and productivity increases
      from Sixtus\u2019 aggressive imperialism effort caused deflation. Kaiser argued
      even though one who deposits money will passively earn money, the rapid technological
      advancement from Dionarian, Elven and Titan race and the chaotic Kaiser\u2019s
      rule will force everyone to spend thrifting or else risk being obsolete or
      fall.\r\n\r\nPrivate creditors were definitely getting weakened by Kaiser\u2019s
      deflationary policy; hence many banks become much more restrictive in its lending
      which caused Kaiser family-owned bank (Nexus Bank) becomes the dominant creditor
      of the Sixtusian Empire. It was a significant cut of the privately-owned bank
      and finance industry; insurance, creditors and venture capital were suppressed
      during Kaiser\u2019s rule as the government becomes the dominant force of the
      financial sector.\r\n\r\nThe guarantee of holding Sixtusian Centurion will
      increase ~5% per year meant many people from all over the galaxy rapidly traded
      their homeworld currency with Sixtusian Centurion, this quickly destroyed the
      foreign reserves from Earth and Cassantor. Even though the Pentaempires of
      UDE, Alpha and Elistar Empire heavily restrict Sixtusian trade, many black
      markets from those empires propped up and becoming very powerful by illegally
      selling Sixtusian goods, currency and commodities which are significantly cheaper
      than their racial counterpart. This rapid adoption made the Sixtusian currency
      from 2% of the galaxy in 2016 to 60% by 2030. \r\n\r\nMajority of the empire\u2019s
      income are coming from taxing the megacorporations, upper class and state-owned
      enterprises. Sixtusian biggest revenue SOE are in its mining, hard commodity
      production and construction industry, with this, the Sixtusian government had
      total dominance in producing intermediate goods of the hard commodity market.
      Due to Sixtusian economic dominance, most of private manufacturing companies
      that relies on metal or chemical buys commodities directly from the Sixtusian
      SOEs, this system makes the Sixtusian Empire had absolute monopoly on the commodity
      market.\r\n"
