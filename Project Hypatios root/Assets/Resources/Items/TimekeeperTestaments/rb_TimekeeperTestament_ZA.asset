  - chapterName: 'The Beginning and the World '
    content: "In the galaxy, there were 2 Elder races called the: Titans and the
      Elvens while the rest of it: Cassantors, Humans, Safarian and Dionarians are
      the lesser race of the galaxy. The Elder Races had existed for probably around
      hundreds of thousands of years and competed each other almost perpetually.
      The details of what they have done and its events are scarce and very little
      information survived, only since the rise of United Dionary Empire which is
      the first race that attempts to challenge the Elder race, which more information
      comes to light.\r\nThe Elder races:\r\n\u2022\tTitan: Humanoid race that can
      turn into \u201CTitanbeast\u201D upon given a special substance. The Titanbeast
      resembles a monster.\r\n\u2022\tElven: An elf-like race that are noble, stubborn
      and highly feudalistic.\r\n\r\nThe lesser races:\r\n\u2022\tHumans: The \u201COblivious\u201D.
      It wasn\u2019t until the Sixtusian Empire arrived that they realized the world
      outside and aliens. Had similar volksgeist and weltgeist with the Safarian.\r\n\u2022\tSafarian:
      The \u201CSuppressed\u201D. Chained by Elistar Empire through its proxy: Eltravivor
      Empire for thousands of years. Planet Safar had the Elven in the southern continent
      which monitored Safarian movements.\r\n\u2022\tDionarian: The \u201CSuperior\u201D.
      A reptilian-like race that has the most superior physique compared the other
      lesser races. They challenged the Elder races the first time but then failed,
      stuck in stalemate. They are all consolidated in a few star systems.\r\n\u2022\tCassantors:
      The umbrella race term for animal-like race united together under one identity
      called \u2018Cassantor\u2019. Some similar to wolf, cats, dogs and others.
      This had the largest population and most star systems but were relatively weak
      despite its size. A few Cassantor were under controlled, occupation by the
      Elven.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the rise of the Kaiser, there were 3 major interstellar
      empires:\r\n-\tUnited Dionary Empire: A loosely confederacy comprised of Dionarian
      states of republics, duchies, monarchy, etc. They had massive population of
      50 billion Dionarians but relatively technological weaker than the other three.
      It relies on its manpower. \r\n-\tAlpha Empire: Titan-race empire. It has an
      advanced weaponry and a militaristic empire but their population count is low.\r\n-\tElistar
      Empire: Elf-race empire. Most of its population has an average age of a millennium.
      They were the most powerful interstellar empire until the Sixtusian Empire\u2019s
      victory in War of the Universe.\r\n\r\nThe galactic politics at the genesis
      of the Sixtusian Empire is that these three interstellar empires stuck in a
      gridlock and becomes highly feudalistic, status quo, lack of interesting events.
      The Sixtusian Empire was able to rise rapidly because the only thing separating
      the Sixtusian from power is the knowledge gap not the asset or lack of technology.
      All of the technology, from its weapons, space-travel had already existed from
      the Elder races technologies of hundreds of thousands of years, it is only
      by using Sixtusian\u2019 doctrines and unique utilization that enabled Sixtusian
      rapid breakthrough. The Sixtusian are able to crush the three empires due to
      Sixtusian\u2019s people spirit are fundamentally different than these three
      empires; were able to sees the world in a different perspective, a collective
      agent of destroyers.\r\n\r\nHumans never realized the world outside until the
      Sixtusian Empire arrived in 2016, opening the pandora box. A Warp Gate had
      existed on Sol star system, more precisely on Venus but was long neglected
      by the Titan race then transferred control to the Elven and never paid attention
      to it for thousands of years. The Sixtusian Empire (As Sixtusian Republic)
      first secretly arrived on Earth in 2005 through Warp Gate leased by the Elven
      on Safar, establishing a hidden secret outpost in Venusian atmosphere. It is
      easy to get caught by humans especially its technology level of observing space
      however Kaiser\u2019s Machine of Madness rewind time successfully avoid the
      Sixtusian Earth Expeditionary Force from getting spotted. \r\n\r\nTechnically,
      the humans supposedly belong to the Cassantor group but it was decided separated
      from the Cassantor thanks to the Sixtusian prioritized incorporating the humans
      into the empire which the humans were able to stand out on its own. A big answer
      to why Kaiser wanted to grab the humans into their empire is due to their cultural
      and socio-political similarities to the Safarian race. Despite the Elistar
      Empire had a territory of Queensland for several millennium in the planet Safar\u2019s
      southern continent, its borders are highly closed-off and only very few Safarian
      has ever entered and encountered the Elven. The Elven had the Eltravivor Empire
      as its main puppet state of Safarian race, intended to keep the Safarian in
      a perpetual stagnation. The primary reason the Elven controlled the Safarian
      race is to initiate social experiments and simulation. Computer and integrated
      chips had been long banned both by the Elven and Titan race due to the Elder
      Race were almost wiped out in Cybernetics War that happened a long time ago,
      around 10,000 BC hence they had been staunchly adamant in developing computers
      and nanotechnologies.\r\n\r\nThe feudalist Elder Race enables long stability
      and prevents any innovations. The feudalist system was mandatory, it was an
      unnegotiable political system to prevent the forbidden technology from misused
      and developed, only technology that were important and not dangerous that were
      permitted to be used and to exists. The research and technological institutions
      of the Elder Race output has since long stagnated, hence only very few of the
      population possess an intimate knowledge of science. Democratization of knowledge
      is strictly forbidden in Elder race civilizations.\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Dionarian Race and the United Dionary Empire '
    content: "The Dionarian were living the homeworld of Ionari Planet. The Dionarian
      race like the Safar, was once controlled by the Elven. The Elven had to constantly
      monitor Dionarian activities and did some political experimentation, however
      the Dionarian revolts and successfully purged the Elven out from their planet.
      Since then, the planet was divided into two major states: United Dionary Empire
      and Dionarian Federative Republics. The UDE is a feudalist empire while the
      DFR is a confederation of republics. The DFR is a relatively neutral and peaceful
      state that has no beef against the Elder races and no colonial ambitions, the
      UDE on other hand was an aggressive, ethno-nationalist state that while it
      has high autonomy internally, it has zero tolerance on outsiders and highly
      paranoid of external threats.\r\n\r\nThe United Dionary Empire is a polity
      comprised of duchies, republics, city-states, dictatorships, Astranian states
      and monarchies, while on the central level, it is an elective monarchy where
      UDE institutions elects its emperor. It works similarly to the Holy Roman Empire
      with the difference is the Hierarch and the emperor sometimes able to exercise
      its command and mobilize its forces in case of a great external threat to the
      UDE. How UDE works is a direct contrast against the Elder Race, where the UDE
      states has high autonomy. In theory, the high autonomy allowed competition,
      innovation and its complex dynamic state system allow significant political
      experimentation however what was happening is that UDE ended up in an eternal
      strive and constant internal struggles. Due to UDE comprising of at constant
      rate of at least a hundred entities, no entity has ever consistently single-handedly
      dominated the politics of UDE. The emperor and the central power constantly
      suppress any entity from becoming too powerful, resources were divided and
      any conflicts will be mediated by the Hierarchs. Any entity attempts to take
      over the Hierarch will always be met with a coalition to take down the aggressor
      entity. With this, the UDE has no capability to research and innovate things
      reliably. It ended up becoming a feudalist empire at its highest level despite
      some of its entities contains a communist state or a capitalist state, it was
      dominated by feudalist, medieval-like spirit.\r\n\r\nThe UDE and FDR were major
      rivals. The Elder races exploited the Dionarian rivalry by subtly supporting
      the FDR. UDE\u2019s attempt to destroy the FDR has failed consistently for
      several millennia; they failed to annex it, annexation has happened but it
      ended breaking away, revolutions and sorts. Any attempt to destroy FDR almost
      ended up in a failure, with its emperor thrown away if invasion failed or if
      conquered, there will be a revolution of dynasty overthrown which the FDR rebels
      almost always took advantage to break away. \r\n\r\nWith the massive political
      cost fiddling the FDR and overpopulation of Planet Ionari, the UDE has since
      focusing on establishing and maturing its outer space colonies. With it, the
      Elder Races and the UDE are the three major interstellar empires competing
      in the limited space.\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Warp Gates '
    content: "Warp Gates are the only way to travel across the galaxy. However, to
      construct it, one must reach the destination first which might take light years
      to reach. As of 2065, there had been over hundreds of Warp Gates that had been
      constructed by the Elven and Titans in their one hundred thousand year of their
      existence. These Warp Gates allowed near-instantaneous travel across the galaxy
      with mostly maximum distance 40 light years, the longest one can reach 90 light
      years. How it works is that it \u2018shoots\u2019 an object to a certain destination
      requiring massive energy. Shooting an entity to a destination must follow a
      very strict procedure where it must only shoot a spaceship and it must target
      to a star system which has an already constructed Warp Gate in it. Best explanation
      is that the spaceship is the car while the Warp Gate is the entry tunnel, when
      exiting, the spaceship will be floating in the star system and must manually
      dock to the nearest spaceport. As of today, there is no possible way for a
      Warp Gate to be attached a spaceship like a warp drive due to technological
      limitations.\r\n\r\nOnly the Elder races were able to construct the Warp Gates
      which the Dionarian have their mercy at them. Constructing a Warp Gate is extremely
      resourceful and took 15-20 years to finish one Warp Gate. It will take significant
      political power and economic power to build one and it is generally unprofitable
      to build one and maintain one. Shooting an entity to an empty space can goes
      horribly wrong, a minor angle deviation from the planet can instantly shoots
      to a totally different place hence most Warp Gates are not limited by its power
      but rather it is its error rate from angle deviations. Most Warp Gates that
      were constructed were transit Warp Gates in order to reach furthest star system.\r\n\r\nAt
      some era, the Elder races unitarily decided to stop constructing new Warp Gate
      due to its extreme costs and diminishing returns. Before the rise of the Kaiser,
      there is only fixed amount of 46-star systems able to travel to in which a
      star system can have multiple Warp Gates. \r\n\r\nWhen the Alpha Empire collapsed
      to the Sixtusian Empire, the Sixtusian acquires the ability to build Warp Gate
      however during Kaiser\u2019s tenure, the Sixtusian Empire able to conquer the
      galaxy and star systems simply by hijack the Warp Gates which was controlled
      by the empires and go to any star systems with Warp Gates in it. Sixtusian\u2019
      project to construct their own Warp Gate were not started until Citadel\u2019s
      regime. The first Sixtusian Warp Gate completed in 2053 in Sagittarius star
      system which contains the main planet of Sagittarius.\r\n"
