  Title: Timekeeper Testaments
  allChapters:
  - chapterName: Chaos Theory, Parallel Universes and Complex Systems
    content: "As a Timekeeper, we can see the parallels of the many universe, each
      with its own slight variations. Chaos theory is very visible for Timekeepers,
      in fact it is one of the first thing that we are able to notice. We saw living
      beings are extremely susceptible to changes, it is like chain reaction, its
      direction can be absolutely unpredictable and within just a week, events from
      far away that supposed to happened, changed because of the minuscule of our
      actions.\r\n\r\nHowever not everything is a butterfly effect. Things that Timekeepers
      wants to affect can be nullified by the \u201COpposite Forces\u201D. These
      opposite forces are for example, you want to manipulate a person but then gets
      negated by their relatives or friends. A stark contrast to non-living organism
      with no complex system. Earthquakes, volcanic explosion and asteroid strikes
      can be very predictable and very hard to be manipulated, it tends to be very
      persistent and no Timekeeper could even stop it unless they completely destroy
      the planet.\r\n\r\nSystems with greater complexity are easily manipulated by
      Timekeepers. Systems that are complex are indicated by its non-linearity, emergence,
      spontaneous order, feedback loop. A Bunderlifean scholar explains regarding
      spontaneous order:\r\n\r\n\u201CThings seemingly stupid but if multiplied into
      millions will becomes intelligent. New properties emerge from dumb things.
      The input needs to be able to take from the output, allowing iterative changes
      and constant improvement. Chaos will create accidentally creates order.\u201D\r\n\r\nEvery
      individual in the world have a task given to them. If all only do one task
      or only worked in agriculture then it will be a very unproductive society,
      instead every person must delegate its task to something, a function. A totalitarian
      state would be very ineffective form of government unless the leader is a God-like
      figure that knows a forbidden knowledge from the future (like the Kaiser).
      Usually a totalitarian kills the imagination of a person, it takes a very na\xEFve
      approach of only designing a society only from its surface rather than having
      faith on the populace to create emergence mechanics.\r\n\r\nIn grand scheme
      of things (from the multiverse perspective), Timekeepers will separate things
      in which they can control and which they can\u2019t. There is a thing called
      inheritance, in which the child must not know what the parent is doing. The
      Timekeepers must know they cannot control things in the past and only things
      within their grasp.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Rules within Kaiser\u2019s Timekeepers"
    content: "The Kaiser was very well aware of the rigidity of an overly authoritative/police
      state. To help realizing the empire, he delegated the tasks from recruited
      Timekeepers. Kaiser\u2019s remarks on establishing an authoritarian yet meritocratic
      system within his government to realize the Sixtusian Empire:\r\n\r\n\u201CUsually
      these pretentious idiot intellectuals thought I am a totalitarian dictator
      and suppress idiot civil rights. Every country is actually suppressing their
      own citizen, every country has a law and that law is a confinement to lock
      people at bay. The biggest different of a democratic system and totalitarian
      system is that people lives in democracy doesn\u2019t know that they are being
      lied to while in totalitarian system they knew they live under lies and repression.
      These new extensive measures of the new Sixtusian government is to laser focus
      our main objective: to build a space empire and build an interstellar hyperpower
      state in the galaxy. If I implement democracy, the neoliberalists and corporations
      will rule the country hence long-term objective of galactic hyperpower state
      can never be achieved.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt is without doubt that Kaiser\u2019s
      policies shifted towards the socialist or leftist spectrum. Food was extensively
      subsidized, not for food security but rather to deliberately limit food production
      in order to gain control of populace. Kaiser absolutely realized the power
      of economy that can control the populace more powerful than any instrument
      or ideological indoctrination. It just works. Kaiser noted:\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
      will be fucking shocked at how flawless the economic machine can do to manipulate
      the population. If you cannot control the population using propaganda then
      you must control them subconsciously, via economy. Mass society are very vulnerable
      to be controlled by the establishment, the economic system, the society and
      its culture. The world will bend towards the upper class\u2019 will and wishes.
      The obeyment of a man and his family to the system, the nation.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt
      is said distracting the population good enough and they will not be able to
      topple the ruling capitalist or upper class. Information is transparent and
      free in the cyberspace however the economic system demands many to work 50
      hours a week hence prevents many people to be able to intellectually analyzes
      texts and diving it deeper. With this centralization of information will again,
      be the norm.\r\n\r\nThis parallels to how the Kaiser\u2019s operate the Timekeepers\u2019
      interests balance. Kaiser\u2019s main goal is to opaque as much as his actions
      as possible by ordering non-sensical orders like send 10 soldiers in Kingsgard
      desert to cut some cactus. Kaiser very much knows that while the Coalition
      of Timekeeper collectively wants to overthrow the Kaiser, each Timekeeper in
      it has different interests and goals. The head of the Coalition, Kingdom Citadel,
      is Kaiser\u2019s right-hand man because Citadel had absolute faith with Kaiser\u2019s
      goals and ideology to rise the Sixtusian Empire but heavily dislikes Kaiser\u2019s
      brutal, authoritarian methods to execute his goals. In many cases, Citadel
      had to concede since Kaiser\u2019s action is pragmatic to rise the empire but
      damaging to the Coalition.\r\n\r\nHowever, Citadel himself also deliberately
      do the \u2018lettement\u2019 (to let it happen) of some horrific things happens
      (like genocide) in order Citadel could rise and convince additional Timekeepers
      to the Coalition to overthrow the Kaiser from power. Compared to Kaiser\u2019s
      Timekeeper which peaked only around 20 Timekeepers, Citadel was able to amassed
      over 300 Timekeepers into the Coalition. Citadel remarked about the Kaiser:\r\n\r\n\u201CThere
      is only two valid opinion of a Timekeeper towards the Kaiser: \u2018I don\u2019t
      care and I don\u2019t want get involved\u2019 or \u2018I hate the Kaiser\u2019.
      There is no in-between. With this, one thing is absolute: Not a single Timekeeper
      likes the Kaiser.\u201D\r\n\r\n"
