  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Problems Towards Religions"
    content: "During Sixtusian Occupation of Earth, King Dragoness\u2019 regime has
      major problem with Islam, especially its political movement. Pahliv Aul Said
      being a Timekeeper has caused significant problem by declaring himself Caliph
      and his caliphate movement. The Kaiser regarded the religion as the most toxic
      religion that cannot be removed but must be \u2018neutralized\u2019 by the
      empire. \r\n\r\nWhen he was asked in an interview about Pahliv\u2019s regime
      shortly after the Caliphate\u2019s fall, he responded:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Caliphate
      is a just another rebel group. The Caliphate pretend itself to be \u2018Oh!
      Rise up my brother! It\u2019s jihad time my friend! We- we must rise up against
      the oppression of this alien, Sixtusian Empire and remove elements of colonialism!
      Oh, we are going to get colonized by Safarian aliens!\u2019. All of these idiots
      do is simply resisting technological and societal progress. It is without doubt
      inferior cultures will become obsolete particularly if the cultures have too
      many rules and restrictions. Few of Earth\u2019s culture will retain but the
      retarded ones will be gone, like the forcing women to wear black ninja shinobi
      clothes all the time or in another religion, women become second-class citizen
      or in another, women become conformist and slave to the man. This multiculturism,
      cultural preservation like UNESCO is idiot. Every culture is trash.\u201D\r\n\r\nKaiser
      had main ideology is the Uberwelt, ideology meant superior culture; this superior
      culture was a critical part of the Sixtusian Empire expansion which meant all
      cultures melded into one super culture which takes it from every culture however
      thanks to religion, Islamic countries was in particular highly resistant against
      assimilated into Sixtusian culture particularly Sixtusian populace\u2019s pro-LGBT,
      majority atheist state and anti-religion. Religious cultures are protectionist,
      isolationist and orthodox in its nature, effort by the Kaiser was futile and
      it was very hard to \u2018replace\u2019 the culture.\r\n\r\nKaiser absolutely
      hated religions that is not compliant to Kaiser\u2019s version of super culture.
      Many of Islamic culture, customs and ideologies directly against Sixtusian
      values. This caused friction with local Sixtusians. When immigrants started
      to flow in to the empire after the Caliphate collapsed, their refusal to abandon
      their custom, the hot-headed and \u2018self-righteous defender of the faith\u2019
      behavior inhabited by many of its followers clashed with Sixtusian local citizens.
      Riots were widespread. Sixtusian politicians somehow mitigate this by creating
      special district and send them to King Canyon Town which is a city overwhelmed
      with immigrants. However, the KCT city quickly sprawled into one of the most
      dangerous cities with both being the poorest and highest crime in the entire
      nation, every month there\u2019ll be an interethnic/religious violence between
      Muslim or/and other immigrants. Kaiser blamed their idiocy and orthodoxy of
      not abandoning their customs and absorbing Sixtusian culture for their suffering.\r\n\r\nIn
      Kaiser\u2019s observation he saw the religion\u2019s orthodoxy and haram-ization
      of bi\u2019dah has caused these Muslims to be intellectually backwards. People
      inside the faith has severe restriction or at least feared reprisal or afraid
      committing of sins. To do anything they must consulted to their local religious
      leader to adhere the conventional pieties. Kaiser believes these convoluted
      systems with a thousand pages holy book made it impossible for normal people
      to read. The worse of it is when a believer of a religion are forbidden to
      learn from a book or other religion even though that may contain an important
      lesson. Kaiser remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CThese idiots will call people unbelievers,
      atheists or kafir, whatever these morons want to say just because a man is
      curious or thirst of knowledge. But one thing I found the most ridiculous is
      the idea that EVERYTHING must come from the holy book as the primary source,
      de facto, the truth of the world. If Chronostians were forcibly convert to
      that religion, all of Chronostians will commit seppuku.\u201D \r\n\r\nFurther,
      the mandate issued by religion is regarded by the Kaiser as \u2018idiotic\u2019.
      In one of his interviews with the state media, he called them and other religions
      out: \r\n\r\n\u201CYou have idiots clinging their faith to millennium-old religion.
      Then every religion, has these \u2018reformers\u2019 and \u2018orthodox\u2019.
      These two factions basically it said itself, one wants to reform to better
      adapt to the new society or the orthodox are basically conservatives who wants
      to going back to the fucking roots or whatever. If you look the retarded Marxist,
      Fairtolic, Safarian Communitarianism, Chronostianity, is the same shit, you
      have one side says, \u2018oh We must going back to the roots! We must adhere
      to the old values!\u2019 then you have idiot hermeneutics analyzer analyzes
      biblical texts, Communist Manifesto, religious texts to interpret or \u2018tafsir\u2019
      the texts and twisted them with mental gymnastics to fit with the \u2018new
      political revivalist movement\u2019. Faggot revivalist movement like the Salafist,
      Jehovah or basically any political movements is technically just to make the
      poor bastard to be brainwashed and be ruled by the elites.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
      Kaiser noted the religion is big is not necessarily it was good but rather
      the religion is to enlarge via populist promises. Hermeneutic analyzer did
      some revisionist movement that appropriate the religion to be more accessible
      to the masses according to the current condition of the world. \r\n"
