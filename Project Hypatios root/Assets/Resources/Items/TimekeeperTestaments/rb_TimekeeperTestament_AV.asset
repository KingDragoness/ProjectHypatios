  - chapterName: Uberwelt/Superculture
    content: "Uberwelt or Superior Culture, is one of Kaiser\u2019s ideological justification
      for Sixtusian imperialism and expansionism. Uberwelt are aimed to make a melting
      pot culture that takes elements from many cultures with the ultimate goal is
      to make a highly saturated colorful society comprised of many ethnics, race
      and religions which can make the society more complex, emergence mechanics
      and to expand the \u2018greater entity\u2019 of civilization. These are all
      ties to Sixtusian Empire main ideology of Social-Capitalism which by establishing
      a society with greater complexity will have the possibility of liberating the
      workforce.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the superculture or Uberwelt, it is to build a
      superior culture that recognizes the need of letting pockets of society exists
      with every group has its own purpose, interest and behavior however it needs
      a holistic narrative, a cohesiveness of the entire people where all agreed
      to some universal values, in Sixtusian case: liberate the workforce and delegate
      it to the machineries. By creating a grand narrative, it can greatly distract
      menial differences between contrasting cultures and focus on greater goals.\r\n\r\nHowever,
      Kaiser\u2019s ideological quest of liberating the workforce are halted by the
      feudalistic system of the UDE, Elistar, Alpha and the strong conservative religions.
      The UDE, Elistar and Alpha has been highly resistant against Sixtusian reform
      from semi-feudal to social-capitalism as it threatens destabilization and handed
      power to the masses. Kaiser argued feudalism while allows stability for centuries
      and reduce chaos, it prevents innovation and desaturate the color of society.
      Kaiser noted that Serfdom, slavery and caste are systems that will return if
      technology and societal changes were slow as it will make rulers to pursue
      materialistic things via conquest rather than expend its capital to develop
      its education and researching new innovations. \r\n\r\nOn one example, Sixtusian
      heavy influence on Earth meant its ideology started permeated to Earth. It
      then greatly clashed with many conservative religions especially Islam. Sixtusian\u2019
      ultra-progressive society with its LGBT, secularism and liberalism becomes
      a point of contention for many religions on Earth. Pahliv Aul Said being a
      Timekeeper took an advantage of this and exploit it by moderating as the only
      person able to balance between implementing Sixtusian technology while retaining
      old Islamic values against Sixtusian Uberwelt influence which argued attempt
      to wipe the cultures of Earth. It then caused more significant problem by declaring
      the caliphate movement to overthrow the Sixtusian out from Earth. \r\n\r\nWhen
      asked about the problem of religions shortly after the fall of the Caliphate:\r\n\r\n\u201CI
      hate these retarded Caliphate that self-proclaims itself as an \u2018repressed\u2019
      noble \u2018Jihadist\u2019 defender of the faith to protect itself from so-called
      scary \u2018progressive\u2019 society with LGBT, atheism and secularism. Idiots
      chanted to evict the alien Sixtusian Empire out from Earth. These shithole
      Islamic movement attempting to desaturate the color of society and crushing
      the complexity of society. All wears white or black clothes, forcing women
      to wear shitty Burqa black \u2018ninja-shinobi\u2019 clothes. Intellectualism
      are crushed, demagogue Islamic politicians uses the damn holy book all the
      time as the populist instrument to control the masses, unbelievers are persecuted,
      anything that is incompatible with their religion will be persecuted. But thank
      God, Pahliv Aul Said is at the very least, attempted to launch bi\u2019dah
      or reformation/innovation like the Christianity with its Protestant revolution.
      And don\u2019t even get me started with any of the \u2018revivalist\u2019 movement.
      Hermeneutics analyzer interpret religious texts or any political book and twist
      the narrative with mental gymnastics to whatever they like to build a new religious
      revivalist movement to \u2018go back to its roots\u2019. Revisionist idiots!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
      Sixtusian Empire has practically absorbed every value and tradition of all
      cultures. Even taking junk values and useless superstition. Kaiser, even though
      pragmatic, secular and doesn\u2019t believe in any superstition remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CSuperstition
      works even though you don\u2019t believe it.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe explained that
      superstition works for traditionalist, cultural preservation which added the
      absurdism value in a culture. This absurd, seemingly useless superstition belief
      can act as a potential low-entry barrier interaction for connection with people,
      a shared value amongst differing cultures. Without the superstition or any
      of the values absorbed, there will be a situation where two very differing
      cultures will inevitably be clashed together greatly then it will fall into
      a great war. Absorption of trivial things was needed to adopt and understanding
      the culture of other and eventually, supersede the old inferior culture.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Regime on LGBT and Polyamory"
    content: "Kaiser\u2019s position on LGBT is neutral and, infamously opportunistic.
      Under Sixtusian\u2019 ultra-progressive society, Kaiser\u2019s primary objective
      is to remove the strong influence of LGBT politics in order to shift focus
      on space imperialism, militarism and social-capitalism. He sees it as more
      of distraction and holding back Kaiser\u2019s goals. He remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CSixtus
      has developed into a polyamory society where children are shared, family structure
      is an absolute chaos and everyone can basically fuck together with consent.
      This happened\u2026 decades before I went to power. Basically, the Sixtusian
      Republic during the junta regime are gearing itself towards service-based economy
      which destroyed the conservative family structure. The War for the End basically
      screwed everything by killing a lot of Sixtusian which upsets the nuclear family
      structure. Then, the polyamory movement takes off to allow the task of taking
      care of child will be more viable.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CEssentially, polyamory
      is what 60% people today are. I won\u2019t complain anything with that. The
      old family structure is simply obsolete, it is a legacy system that is inevitably
      to dissipate.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn Sixtus, the practice of selling a baby was common
      due to economic system and its dynamic sexual relationship. A woman can choose
      to get pregnant from unmarried partner, gave birth to baby and legally sell
      it to a state-owned hospital, which earns them around \u20AC 90,000 - \u20AC120,000,
      2 years\u2019 worth of salary. The sold child if not adopted, will be under
      \u2018government-care\u2019 until it reached 17 years old.\r\n\r\nKaiser called
      Sixtus a \u2018progressive liberal nightmare\u2019 and possess \u2018the most
      disgusting society system\u2019 but Kaiser\u2019s antagonism towards Sixtus\u2019
      ultra-progressive society was forcibly muted due to Social-Capitalism\u2019
      \u2018liberating the workforce\u2019 doctrine in that, Sixtusian society has
      destroyed its conservative family structure and become polyamorous in order
      to gain additional freedom, individualism and more time can be allocated to
      work rather than trivial bureaucratic structure of the old family structure;
      basically the \u2018Berlin Wall\u2019 nature of family structure is now torn
      down.\r\n\r\nKaiser stated with opinion about the LGBT:\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t
      like this ridiculous notion of \u2018Yes, I have found my true identity and
      gender\u2019. It proclaims itself as finding one\u2019s true self and finally
      found the so-called \u2018true identity\u2019. But why bending yourself to
      an identity and inventing ridiculous unpragmatic shit? To be clear, I am 100%
      believer that gender is social constructivism but the one thing I hate is they
      themselves confine their identity to the LGBT group. It is rather odd if they
      associate with that, why not being a \u2018totally free independent being\u2019
      that is not associated with any group?  By becoming hot-headed non-ideological
      person is closer to become your \u2018true identity\u2019. For that is closer
      to true emancipation of one\u2019s self.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFor me it is apparent
      clear. For most, they joined that group is the same tribal doctrine of \u2018my
      tribe\u2019. Same interest means we will help each other, that\u2019s it. And
      there is nothing with that but don\u2019t proclaim with pretentious philosophical
      shit of \u2018gaining true one\u2019s self\u2019 or \u2018this is my true gender\u2019
      shit.\u201D\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Self-Centeredness Problem"
    content: "Kaiser disliked the idea of self-centeredness, self-care or the idea
      of loving yourself. He remarked on the issue:\r\n\r\n\u201CSelf-centeredness
      is retarded concept led by fatfuckers, LGBT movements or other idiots that
      attempt to justify its laziness and immobility towards greatness. Hiding behind
      its identity and its inferiority is the epitome of a person who is incapable
      of change. People who don\u2019t build sufficient feedback loops to correct
      itself; not being in anxiety and stays in the status quo of mediocrity will
      be drown in their own biases, world view confined to their own views and an
      echo chamber.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPeople who are in the social circle of un-improving
      and lack of hurtful, spicy comments for feedback are stuck in a vicious circle.
      Recycling of the same opinions. Community acts like \u2018Berlin Wall\u2019
      to protect a person from the outsider, even though the outsider may give valuable
      lesson. Hence, this circling inside the community is devil\u2019s circle that
      can worsened biases, leaving permanent flawed idea to their own brain to the
      point when you\u2019re an adult, you cannot grasp new concept and idea anymore.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor
      the Kaiser, balancing between individualism and communitarian is important.
      In line with Social-Capitalism, Kaiser believes that self-centeredness must
      in the right balance so that the individual identity can be preserved for small
      innovation, attack against the system while some kind of outsider feedback
      can be used to improve one\u2019s self and to be better in retrospective of
      one\u2019s self.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Repressed Consciousness of the Masses '
    content: "In a society, everyone has their own repressed negative behaviours
      in order to keep the harmony society in tact however a pattern will emerge
      hence that common repressed behavior is the \u2018repressed consciousness\u2019.
      \r\n\r\nIn sexual relationship, many people like threesome or interchangeable
      sexual partners but usually the legacy system of the old society prevented
      people to conduct such behaviour or action. In Sixtus, p is the most common
      type of relationship, people able to conduct casual sex with many people without
      significant consequences. Sixtus was able to liberate much of the social barriers
      hence many repressed consciousness of the masses had been liberated compared
      to other societies. By doing artificial social barriers, they have repressed
      their own desires. When these repressed desires accumulate, it will snowball
      people\u2019s frustration towards the system and if left untreated, there will
      be major societal consequences, i.e: Repressing sex will cause fertility collapse.\r\n\r\nSixtusian
      society had reorganized itself to bring a total \u2018destruction\u2019 of
      its conventional and conservative relationship structure. The old family structure
      of 1 man and 1 wife is a legacy system that have been \u2018purged\u2019, it
      was incompatible with current technology and economic system as cited by Sixtusian
      sociologists. \r\n\r\nKaiser had numerous warnings to any countries that attempt
      to adopt highly advanced Sixtusian technology while staunchly defend its cultures
      and not adopting Sixtus\u2019 social-capitalism society structure:\r\n\r\n\u201CTo
      steal, to make is easy but to innovate from scratch while retaining your pathetic
      culture and way of thinking is impossible. The Sixtusian able to rise this
      fast only because it liberated the repressed consciousness of the masses. If
      you do not liberate it, then you will only cause false consciousness; a misalignment
      and disconnection with reality.\u201D\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Eternal Stage of Social-Capitalism '
    content: "The primary premise of Social-Capitalism is that it assumes a country
      will stuck in an eternal stage of shifting between centralization and decentralization
      policies. It assumes the importance of both welfarism and centralization of
      wealth to the ruling class. The idea of accumulation of wealth is good because
      it can concentrate the wealth to create some projects which can potentially
      benefits the masses. Meanwhile the idea of distributing wealth is good because
      it allows small people to contribute society\u2019s complex system to have
      adaption, feedback loops and emergence which can innovate.\r\n\r\nThe Sixtusian
      Empire is the only empire that adheres to this ideology. Other empires like
      Elistar, United Dionary Empire, Alpha Empire which has existed for thousands
      of years all developed into semi-feudalist empire with caste system and strong
      separation of classes. This is because feudalist structure allows high stability
      at the cost weak reforms and low innovation. The caste system allows for highly
      efficient society which the labour is properly divided from one\u2019s birth.
      With this, the Elistar, UDE and Alpha has practically turned its working class
      to a total alienation where they all has lost the ability determine to its
      own life and destiny.\r\n\r\nWhen the UDE lost the War of the Universe in 2036,
      the Sixtusian Empire forced the UDE to open up its economy and rapidly introduced
      new machinery which fundamentally changed UDE\u2019s social-economic structure
      to social-capitalism, causing a massive chaos. Sixtusian reforms to UDE\u2019s
      economy is using Dionarian as their cheap labourers while the Sixtusian gradually
      becomes the capitalists, dictate the goods to be produced, hence liberating
      Sixtusian\u2019 workforce. These had major consequences.\r\n\r\nFirst, Sixtusian
      forces all UDE\u2019s subject states to major land reforms. UDE subjects that
      were republics or had high liberty are fundamentally unchanged by this policy
      but monarchy-like subject states which are the dominant government form of
      many UDE\u2019s subjects quickly fall into chaos. The unrealistic high targets
      issued by Sixtusian government to UDE monarchy-like subject state was unable
      to keep up. To enforce this, the Sixtusian Outerboundary government randomly
      picks one of the ruler\u2019s family to be killed if the demands are not held.
      However, when the demands able to keep up, the lower class of Dionarians were
      revolting against their landlords and aristocrat classes. Some places Dionarian
      launched massive classicide against the upper class, causing the Sixtusian
      Outerboundary to forcibly take control of the vacant government.\r\n"
