  - chapterName: Uberwelt/Superculture
    content: "Uberwelt or Superior Culture, is one of Kaiser\u2019s ideological justification
      for Sixtusian imperialism and expansionism. Uberwelt are aimed to make a melting
      pot culture that takes elements from many cultures with the ultimate goal is
      to make a new \u2018saturated colorful\u2019 society comprised from many ethnics,
      race and religions which can make the society more complex, emergence mechanics
      and to expand the \u2018greater entity\u2019 of civilization. The reality of
      Uberwelt however, is to expand the Sixtusian Empire and somewhat ties to its
      main ideology of Social-Capitalism which by establishing a society with greater
      complexity will have the possibility of liberating the workforce.\r\n\r\nThe
      anti-conservative culture of Sixtus is primarily stemmed of Safarian race 900
      years (from 1000 AD -1900 AD) of cultural and technological stagnation primarily
      caused by Elistar Empire impose anti-progression policy in Safar through Eltravivor
      Empire as its proxy state. The Elven race has manipulated the geopolitics of
      Safar into an eternal perpetual war between Salatan and Eltravivor Empire as
      it becomes a somewhat an entertainment and an experiment for the Elven. The
      gridlock situation was finally broken with rise of Social-Capitalism and Communitarianism
      movements in the 19th century with both of these destroyed Eltravivor in War
      of the End from 1967-1975 which ended up in a Sixtusian large-scale systematic
      genocide against the Eltravivor from 1975-1984 for being \u2018traitor for
      the Safarian race\u2019. With the fall of Eltravivor, Sixtus becomes one of
      the great powers in Safar and turns into the most culturally progressive and
      diverse country in Safar.\r\n\r\nUberwelt main objective is to build a superior
      culture that taking elements from all major cultures, religions, ethnics and
      race. However, in reality, Sixtusian Uberwelt is only a set dressing for establishing
      Sixtus as a superpower social-capitalist state, it is the equivalent of United
      States\u2019 false promise of \u2018American Dream\u2019, individualism and
      freedom. The practice and reality of the Uberwelt is not peaceful coexistence
      of multiple cultures but it is to merge all culture in the world into one \u2018universally\u2019
      accepted culture which this new culture has resolve every conflict with each
      other. With it, the new culture resolves all conflicts and people can focus
      on greater goals (like liberate the workforce and productivity) rather than
      be distracted on \u2018stupid\u2019 trivial, religious matters.\r\n\r\nKaiser
      concerned when culture refused to infuse new ideas. There are two spectrums
      of cultural diversity: homogeneous (one-dominant culture) and heterogeneous
      (multiculturalism). Each has its own advantages and disadvantages:\r\n\r\n\u201CMulticulturalism
      and multi-ethnic state are a major problem in that no one is unified. Idiot
      ultra-progressives chanted multiculturalism. This \u2018united in diversity\u2019
      is absolutely retarded, if people with different values and ethics lived in
      a neighborhood, they will not be unified. Instead, they will build walls. This
      is especially true when the two cultures never reached consensus and its conflicts
      left unresolved.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think it is absolute insanity for Earth,
      in Europe to be precise, that they haven\u2019t resolve the cultural conflict
      between Islam and secularism but they decided to grab immigrants to the country.
      This reckless and a complete madness!\u201D\r\n\r\nKaiser faced with major
      problems of heterogeneous society on attempting to put people of different
      cultures living on the same neighborhood: the rise of ambiguity and opaqueness.
      The opaqueness is the big problem in that a person from certain religion can
      uses their \u2018religion card trick\u2019 to avoid working long hours or avoid
      doing some tasks/ actions. The big hypocrite of multicultural state like Indonesia
      or United States, is that de jure, they proclaim the diversity but the common
      misconception is that people thinks is that having people of different ethnics,
      race and culture is \u2018totally sustainable\u2019. Kaiser said:\r\n\r\n\u201CPeople
      likes to think that it is possible to make three cultures exists together.
      This is madness. No cultures can exist together without either breaking apart
      or extinct/absorbed. Two contrasting differing values of different religions
      will absolutely conflict. If you fail to resolve this, it will keep getting
      bigger until it explodes into an inevitable war, either war in 10 years or
      war in 100 years.\u201D\r\n\r\nKaiser argued most people in the United States
      simply never bothered to discuss their religion, cultures or anything. The
      people in the higher ups or tech companies usually operated at a what Kaiser
      quote, \u201Csecular, international, universalist, purist culture\u201D:\r\n\r\n\u201CNo
      idiots in corporations would want people to discuss religion or insert their
      values to the company. Companies diversified their employees and hire people
      from different ethnics, religions and race as if they are buying autistic colorful
      decorations for the office to make it more \u2018lively\u2019. The only way
      to collaborate of many differences is to trash one\u2019s traditions of a religion,
      race or whatever in the office and impose \u2018secular universalist\u2019
      values.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, culture itself can be an ambiguity. It is a very
      vague and blurred line. The big problem is that culture can encapsulate other
      cultures, forming a nested structure or an evolution, syncretic. A state with
      homogeneous culture does not form because of external threats, but rather the
      lack of it. Heterogeneous tends to form thanks to external threats hence people
      are much likely to unified there is a constant external threat. With a heterogeneous
      country, a bigger culture forms to main theme of example: \u2018the Other who
      wants to destroys all of us\u2019. Kaiser argues heterogeneous country cannot
      survive in an era of peace, at all. Different people can only unite if there\u2019s
      a greater threat beyond. It is during peace does a country under went homogenization:\r\n\r\n\u201CThis
      is a great paradox of peace. If you went to peace and you are the top of the
      world, there will be people started fighting each other for whose culture (country\u2019s
      subculture) will be dominant. With the process, over time, there will be homogenization.
      If resist homogenization, there will be a civil war and those who triumphs
      will become The Culture.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe advantage of a homogeneous country
      is undisputed: cultures were much more unified, its values were similar and
      rituals were similar, stability is guaranteed, no room for \u2018corruption\u2019
      and the error is smaller. While highly efficient and easily mobilizable, it
      has major flaw: it has potentiality limits and inability to see things from
      multiple perspective. Heterogeneous society on the other hand has a much greater
      potential. Complex society allows for emergence and mixing other cultures altogether.
      \r\n\r\nThe modern culture of South Korea and Japan has been mixed with numerous
      influences from all over Earth, it has been synthesized into a new form, modern
      form. K-Pop and anime are currently part of the \u2018secular universalist
      culture\u2019 not a \u2018ethnic-identity culture\u2019. This new abstract
      culture is the progressive medium to deliver its messages in a new, more effective
      and more inclusive without restrict it one\u2019s ethnic or race. Being a radical
      traditionalist, conservative preserve the culture\u2019s purity but at the
      risk of stuck being unable to spread. A huge potential culture that needs to
      be mixed influences from the West and presented in a modern, contemporary style
      narrative or else it cannot spread itself naturally. Both Chinese, Indonesian,
      Indian and others suffer from what Kaiser called \u2018Western Exoticism Fetishes\u2019
      in that it is not treated as \u2018modern\u2019 but rather cultural preservation
      UNESCO thingy with failing to attract modern kids while only \u2018boomers\u2019
      had attraction to it. Only a modern form of a culture, synthesized new culture
      does a kid or teenager will successfully attracted to a culture like Japanese
      and South Korean culture.\r\n\r\nThere was significant effort of the \u2018cultural
      protectionist\u2019 trend on Earth especially after Kaiser\u2019s failed effort
      of Uberwelt-ing the Earth, to bring Earth\u2019s culture under the umbrella
      of the Sixtusian culture. When the Europeans attempted to import immigrants
      to their own country, they faced major anti-immigrant movements, this is due
      to Europe is a strictly \u2018ethnic-identity culture\u2019 very similar to
      Japan, South Korea and China, makes them actually incompatible with \u2018universalist
      culture\u2019. Conservatives asserts the cultural hygiene of Europe is retained
      to prevent it from being contaminated from the \u2018Muslim\u2019 or \u2018Islamic\u2019
      influences.\r\n\r\nThe United States is a very unique instance and the closest
      thing to \u2018Uberwelt\u2019. Other nations classified as the Uberwelt is
      Australia, Canada, Brazil, Philippines and Indonesia as all of these nations
      has no dominant ethnic or race. Countries with actual high cultural diversity
      like India or Iran cannot be classified as such due to its national and political
      policies that discourages diversity: one is a Hindu state and the other is
      Shia state. The European states with strong stance of its people, some kind
      of nationalism like Germany, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, Poland has a political
      system and the primary national spirit did not allow immigration or multiculturalism.
      France on the other hand is best suited for it due to its motto of equality
      and liberty which if a French politician is against immigration, it then against
      the state/nation\u2019s spirit. \r\n\r\nThe United States high openness, liberty
      and lack of government has made it for sure, an immortal state that will always
      stays on the great power status. Kaiser said there is no country or entity
      in the world that could rival the United States in its hegemonic, multiculturalism
      power; Europe will certainly fail due to its radical culture protectionism
      and preserve its cultural hygiene. China, Japan and South Korea will eventually
      be stuck due to being a strictly a homogeneous country. Kaiser however, noted
      an entity that could: ASEAN. Kaiser saw ASEAN as the greatest threat to the
      United States due to its diversified culture and its openness to diversity,
      however most of the sovereign states in ASEAN were an \u2018ethno state\u2019:
      Malaysian Malaysia, Thai Thailand, Burmese Myanmar, Cambodian Cambodia, Laotian
      Laos and Vietnamese Vietnam. Only Singapore and Indonesia are its core: secular
      and no ethnic dominant state like the United States or the French.\r\n\r\nThe
      synthetization of a new culture (as a Uberwelt) was needed to cohesively unifies
      the cultures of many. It takes elements from as many cultures as possible and
      Uberwelt basically dictated that even taking junk values and useless superstition
      will be beneficial:\r\n\r\n\u201CSuperstition works even though you don\u2019t
      believe it.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe explained that superstition works for traditionalist,
      cultural preservation which added the absurdism value in a culture like a joke.
      This absurd, seemingly useless superstition belief can act as a potential low-entry
      barrier interaction for connection with people, a shared value amongst differing
      cultures. Superstition tends to be an easy funny cultural exchange, some kind
      of universality. Absorption of trivial things was needed to adopt and understanding
      the culture of other and eventually, supersede the old inferior culture.\r\n\r\nThe
      Sixtusian Republic had always been multiculturalism state with its population
      mainly are immigrants from all over Safar. When Eltravivor Empire fell in 1975,
      the \u2018external enemy\u2019 has been eliminated and heterogeneous culture
      becomes a headache. For multiculturalism in Sixtus to prevail is to make the
      other culture an enemy. On the 2000s, the Kaiser while not a politician, had
      been stirring the masses of the Elven\u2019s long \u2018colonization\u2019
      and \u2018settlement\u2019 in the Southern continent and manipulating the Safarian
      race for tens thousands of years. Kaiser called for the \u2018breaking the
      chain of oppression\u2019. The Sixtusian Empire was then formed as a multiracial,
      multicultural empire that was the opposite of other interstellar empires.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Repression of Progressives\u2019 Political Consciousness "
    content: "Upon Kaiser\u2019s rise to power, Sixtusian ultra-progressive society
      are poising a major threat to Kaiser\u2019s imperialist ambitions. To shut
      down the oppositions, Kaiser employed the Totalitarian Youth to crush the influence
      and repress the political movements of the liberals, ultra left socialists
      and progressives. Kaiser\u2019s totalitarianism style meant he needs to equally
      represses every single political movement that is not in line of his movement
      including the conservatives, LGBT, any religion, ethnics and race. Kaiser was
      not a dogmatist ideological vanguard, he rather is a pragmatic and takes any
      policies from every political ideology that can help to raise the empire quickly.
      Kaiser\u2019s early rule primary objective is to remove the strong influence
      of Sixtusian progressivism, LGBT politics in order to shift focus on space
      imperialism, militarism and social-capitalism. He sees it as more of distraction
      and holding back Kaiser\u2019s goals. He not only sees progressivism a distraction
      but also the others:\r\n\r\n\u201CIslamic cultures are repressing intellectualism
      and secularism on Earth. Combined with its rapid population growth, it is a
      cancer that needs to be eliminated through chemotherapy. Some \u2018good\u2019
      cells will die and some \u2018bad\u2019 cells will die.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor the
      Kaiser, it is utterly unrealistic that a country must bow to the progressives.
      He called progressives were \u2018overly revolutionary\u2019 in that their
      attempt to destroy the social constructivism by the heterosexuals, they also
      attempted to destroy the underlying systems that were barely connected to it.
      He parallels it to the proletariat communist revolution of being \u2018revolutionary
      fetishism\u2019 or dismantling too many systems at once.\r\n\r\nKaiser called
      Sixtus a \u2018progressive liberal nightmare\u2019 and possess \u2018the most
      disgusting society system\u2019 but Kaiser\u2019s antagonism towards Sixtus\u2019
      ultra-progressive society was largely muted due to his vanguardist stance of
      Social-Capitalism\u2019 \u2018liberating the workforce\u2019 tenet in that,
      Sixtusian society has become more productive by destroying its conservative
      family structure, become polyamorous and the torn down of \u2018Great Rigid
      Wall\u2019 of family structure. The breakdown of conservative social values
      allows unique economic activities that is not seen in other countries. This
      caused comparative advantage and innovation, which the Kaiser absolutely needed
      to raise the empire:\r\n\r\n\u201CWe gain money by doing what the other not
      doing.\u201D\r\n\r\nSixtusian society has developed into a polyamory society
      where children are shared, family structure is non-existent and everyone can
      have consensual sexual relationships without any constraints. Sixtusian nuclear
      family structure was unsustainable beginning from its inception, then The War
      for the End from 1967 to 1975 is the final nail in the coffin that led to the
      destruction of conservatism in Sixtus and the rise of progressivism. Since
      then, the polyamory movement takes off which enabled overlapping ownership
      of a child. At the current stats, over 60% people currently claim in a polyamory
      relationship.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this, selling a child was common.
      Abortion was rampant and the lack of strong bonding meant the child usually
      sold to the government. When the sold child if not adopted, it will be under
      \u2018government-care\u2019 until it reached 17 years old. \r\n\r\nHowever,
      Kaiser ultimately prefer LGBT or polyamory parenting to exist rather than having
      no child at all or unmarried, calling childless the worst possible decision
      and \u2018a million times better to have unconventional parenting/relationship
      than to have no child at all\u2019. He called childless is an absolute danger
      of the state\u2019s demographics, he remarks:\r\n\r\n\u201CHaving only a single
      child, is worst for the parent and worst for the child but the best for capitalists.
      No siblings meant parent\u2019s overreliance on one child. By stripping the
      family, the child will be in alienated and isolation hence easily manipulated
      by the mass society. For me, the dynamic of both family and mass society must
      equal and balanced.\u201D\r\n\r\nLGBT radicalism in Sixtusian Empire is primarily
      caused by social constructionism that had beneficial for heterosexual which
      LGBT people are disadvantaged people who revolts against the system and Sixtus
      being the first modern Safarian state to adopt progressive ideologies which
      most of Safarian history is under heterosexual dominance for thousands of years.
      For some, being an LGBT or creating of one\u2019s gender is to find one\u2019s
      true identity. However, Kaiser utterly opposed the philosophy of LGBT of \u2018finding
      true identity and gender\u2019, he believes that \u2018existence precedes essence\u2019
      in that one becomes influenced more by the environment. He remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CI
      don\u2019t like this ridiculous notion of \u2018I have found my true identity
      and gender\u2019. I found people who attempts to reorient its sexual orientation
      were taken into too much into the metaphysical realm and abandoning the materialist/real
      world by rejecting introspection of one\u2019s self. They become detached from
      reality that they became biased of their own making.\u201D\r\n\r\nAn identity
      and what a person can be according to the Kaiser is malleable and tends to
      be formable. When a person declares itself as an LGBT, it is not necessarily
      always the \u2018true identity\u2019 and \u2018who I am\u2019. It is simply
      bending to the mass society\u2019s LGBT movement at the current epoch, it is
      not a total controller of its gender but rather mimics the contemporary social
      environment. Kaiser said it is no different than any other movements and it
      can obstruct the transformation process of a person to become the greatest
      version of itself or progress further down the line. It is in itself a social
      construct, invented by a group of people who had been disadvantaged by the
      world dominated of heterosexuals. For Kaiser, this is simply a tribe, ethnic
      or group of people fighting each other, progressive vs conservatives. The economic
      and political system changes needed to enable these progressive movements.
      In other epoch of history, this wouldn\u2019t be possible or even able to be
      conceived from anyone\u2019s imagination.\r\n\r\nAs Timekeeper were uniquely
      able to switch identities and posits itself from multiple perspective thanks
      to its time loop, Kaiser actively knows the structuralism issue that enforced
      one\u2019s identity to be confined to a certain shape set by the society at
      certain epoch. For this, it is all only the problem relativism and \u2018being-thrown\u2019
      in the world like a male will mostly likely confined itself to male stuffs,
      resisting it can potentially only cause additional obstacles and focuses on
      the obstacles too much, unable to progress.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s View of Religion "
    content: "For the Kaiser, people who treated religion as the emancipatory and
      enlightenment are perfectly makes sense in the context of the medieval era.
      It is unifying piece of literature with a massive cult and fanbase. The problem
      for the Kaiser however, is the treatment of it and how it already become obsolete
      in the modern era yet some still clinging to it without any \u2018revision\u2019.
      Dogmas and written rules inside it were treated as the absolute rules that
      all of its followers must obey. Instructions were worded in such a way that
      it was like a command or a mandate to its followers, and worst, its followers
      treated it as indisputable facts by God that must not be crossed or disagreed.
      Kaiser mentioned the absurdity of the Muslims who attempts to behead any kafir/non-believers:\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
      is an absolute insanity that this religion still let to exist. It will be a
      thorn on our side and thereby we must flatten this religion down. One of their
      branches: Shias and Ibadi were itself were Muslim and they still get persecuted.
      If this they couldn\u2019t even have a reconciliation between themselves how
      about those, they shouted kafir? If they rule the world, they will fucking
      commit cultural genocide en masse, all obey like a hive mind creatures and
      society is like a totalitarian society and that is an absolute total destruction
      of civilization and complex society.\u201D\r\n\r\nOne thing surprising for
      the Kaiser is that he is not a staunch atheist or non-believers. Due to Kaiser\u2019s
      experience as a Timekeeper, Kaiser simply told that the things happening in
      prophets in Abrahamic religion had a possibility of being real. Kaiser refuse
      to believe nor deny its existence, he simply posits a possibility.\r\n\r\nWhen
      Kaiser controversially said he called Islam or some other religion/ideology
      as \u2018cancer that needs to be chemotherapize\u2019, he meant due to strict
      dogmas and its rabid nature can potentially destroys other cultures which reduces
      society\u2019s complexity while exacerbate its disadvantages greater. Each
      culture or ideology has its weaknesses which the existence of different cultures
      and religion must exists to cover each other weaknesses just like the division
      of labour or else it will create world of naivet\xE9s and when a disaster strikes,
      a homogeneous society of what Muslim people thought that a 100% Muslim world
      will be a utopia, will unequipped to face a new challenge. Kaiser argues scientific
      endeavour in the Muslim world will be utterly impossible, it will enforce conformity,
      singular mindset like a singularity, hive-mind like entity. When the Caliphate
      was formed during War of the Universe, many Muslims around the world rallied
      behind the movement, they blindly had faith to the Caliph. Kaiser said the
      following:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Muslims are the closest thing to a hive-mind entity
      society. Pahliv the Rebel (Caliph of the Caliphate) issuing orders and all
      Muslims including Muslims in the Sixtus Core are obeying his thoughts. Then
      they had crusade-like defensive stance against anyone attempts to attack their
      religion. If a piece of knowledge or edict against the holy book, they will
      use mental gymnastics or ridiculous circumvention to avoid that like the idiotic
      0% interest rate is banned for Muslims so they used retardedly convoluted alternative
      instruments to do it. The worst they used mob mentality, truth does not matter
      if the mob is satisfied. This is hence I must reduce the population of them
      by conversion or secularize or \u2018pacify\u2019 them.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere
      are other patterns the Kaiser saw, in which he sees like how both Sixtusian
      and Western progressive liberals according to the Kaiser: had severe fetishism
      with LGBT, gender and pronouns that they started to loses with reality. Then,
      Christianity was criticized by the Kaiser as similar to Islamic mob mentality
      particularly in the US conservatives and during the medieval era. He mocked
      Christianity as \u2018proto-socialist\u2019, \u2018Wine-converter man\u2019
      and \u2018Water Levitator\u2019, then the absurdity miracles mentioned in the
      holy book. Kaiser simply called it a work of fiction exaggerated by its authors:\r\n\r\n\u201CThis
      is clearly a fictional tale. I treat this as a bestselling fictional novel
      of the antiquity.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, all religions of humans received a
      \u2018shock\u2019 by the sudden arrival of the \u2018alien\u2019 Sixtusian
      Empire and the revelation existence of other races like the Titan, Dionary,
      Cassantor and Elven. This lead conspiracy theories that the Titan or Elven
      race might have intervene during ancient times that inspires the signs of \u2018Gods\u2019
      however both the Elven and Titan officially denied they have fiddled the humans
      in ancient times but when the Sixtusian conquered the Alpha Empire, they declassified
      Titan race had been fiddling human\u2019s history with very minimal intervention
      during the antiquity using mythology sightings of its angels and other miracles.
      In other case, Elven had lived both on Safarian and Dionarian homeworld with
      direct intervention. Eltravivor Empire for instance, acted as the proxy state
      for the Elistar Empire to control the movements of Safarian. \r\n\r\nThe Caliphate
      early rise was shoved off as another rebellion as many who opposes the rise
      of the Sixtusian Empire but things took for the worse after the July Plot in
      2033 when the brutality of Muslims were unleashed against the world through
      fatwa to restore the caliphate and to dakwah the whole world. The moment when
      the Muslims started massacring Hindus and non-Muslims is when the Kaiser was
      totally baffled of their hive-mind like society and their nature of not questioning
      the authorities. Kaiser saw the fundamental corrupt structure of the religion
      made it impossible to coexist with other religions and race; this made the
      Kaiser to vow on aggressively suppress the religion:\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you
      let this religion exist is beyond me. This is a religion that likes to present
      itself as a peaceful religion, its followers pretentiously claiming it\u2019s
      the greatest religion that teaches everything from finance to the way of life.
      It is highly dangerous when a religion attempts to dictates everything, the
      enforcement of sharia laws demanded every Muslim to follow or punishment is
      inevitable. Those living under the religion were under suppression, crush of
      its potentiality & intellectuality, becoming the worse version of itself. No
      matter how much they proclaim \u2018we will exist coexist peacefully with non-Muslims\u2019,
      one of their main tenets is aggressive dakwah, forceful inviting people into
      their religion using its numerical superiority/mob mentality and secretly \u2018demonize\u2019
      every non-Muslims as kafir. A swift attack on its rotten structure will bring
      the entire shit down.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs in line with Kaiser\u2019s Uberwelt,
      Earth\u2019s West, secularist culture has greatly clashed with Islamic culture.
      He called that war will always be inevitable due to its contrasting values.
      Christianity and Judaism was similarly staunchly orthodox like Islam but through
      the process of secularization and European enlightenment, it eventually reforms
      itself to become much more relaxed and open to science and criticism. Many
      of Muslims have rejected bi\u2019dah and heavily adopt Sunnah as much as possible,
      this anti-reform attitude is one of the big problems of integrating Muslims
      immigrants into European world. With such great differing view and values,
      Kaiser called Europeans\u2019 Islamophobia is justified and understandable
      especially the \u2018Arab boot-licker idiots\u2019 ingrained the religion with
      the Arab identity, unlike Christianity which is ethnically-agnostic thanks
      the first country who adopts it: The Roman Empire collapsed. It was a religion
      that benefits only the Arabs. Due to Arab and Islam becomes strictly interlinked,
      all Muslims will conform to the Arab world even though they are not Arabs,
      Kaiser mocked Muslims: \u201CAt this stage all of them should just convert
      to Arab, altogether.\u201D\r\n\r\nSixtusian heavy influence on Earth meant
      its ideology started permeated to Earth. It then greatly clashed with many
      conservative religions especially Islam. Sixtusian\u2019 ultra-progressive
      society with its LGBT, secularism and liberalism becomes a point of contention
      for many religions on Earth. For the West and secular states, it wasn\u2019t
      problem but it is the Islamic world where it become a major problem thanks
      to its radical orthodoxy. Pahliv Aul Said being a Timekeeper took an advantage
      of this and exploit it by moderating as the only person able to balance between
      the new Sixtusian values and old Islamic values. He was against Sixtusian Uberwelt
      influence which argued attempt to wipe the cultures of Earth. It then caused
      more significant problem by declaring the caliphate movement to overthrow the
      Sixtusian out from Earth. \r\n\r\nWhen asked about the problem of religions
      shortly after the fall of the Caliphate:\r\n\r\n\u201CI hate these retarded
      Caliphate that self-proclaims itself as an \u2018repressed\u2019 noble \u2018Jihadist\u2019
      defender of the faith to protect itself from so-called scary \u2018progressive\u2019
      society with LGBT, atheism and secularism. Idiots chanted to evict the alien
      Sixtusian Empire out from Earth. These shithole Islamic movement attempting
      to desaturate the color of society and crushing the complexity of society.
      All wears white or black clothes, forcing women to wear shitty Burqa black
      \u2018ninja-shinobi\u2019 clothes. Intellectualism are crushed, demagogue Islamic
      politicians uses the damn holy book all the time as the populist instrument
      to control the masses, unbelievers are persecuted, anything that is incompatible
      with their religion will be persecuted. And don\u2019t even get me started
      with any of the \u2018revivalist\u2019 movement. Hermeneutics analyzer interpret
      religious texts or any political book and twist the narrative with mental gymnastics
      to whatever they like to build a new religious revivalist movement to \u2018go
      back to its roots\u2019. Revivalists idiots!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nKaiser noted
      there is no religion that respects other religion of its values instead, it
      is the blissful ignorance of the multi-religious state to not interfere with
      each other and only to interact with others that is not related to religion
      in where the respect is only from their difference in identity not the religion\u2019s
      tenets, ideas or doctrines. The respect is only \u2018surface level\u2019 which
      is the clothes, the customs, the \u2018exoticism\u2019 and the appearance of
      it.\r\n\r\nKaiser\u2019s criticism of Judaism and Christianity are lesser due
      to the lack of problems with it. Nevertheless, he disliked the fictional nature
      of the books and its ridiculous claims. He called it no better than Islam itself.
      \r\n\r\nThe way it is presented, is that anything written in the book is taken
      off as \u2018knowledge\u2019 and/or \u2018fact\u2019. If it is contradicting,
      some hermeneutic analyzers will use mental gymnastics to justify what it is
      written on the book:\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is the clinging to the old values and
      obsolete texts for too long that make it look like ridiculous.\u201D\r\n\r\nJudaism\u2019s
      chosen people is literally \u2018will to power\u2019 to the collective masses.
      It parallels to Timekeeper\u2019s agent of destroyer and Kaiser\u2019s behavior:
      people who believes they are special and wants to achieve something doesn\u2019t
      always get the achievement but those who never believes in their specialness
      and never attempt will always never gets the achievement. In addition, Jews
      lives in Europe are isolated, floating similarly to Timekeepers as if they
      are disconnected from the masses, hence able to see the world from the anti-thesis
      perspective and contribute significantly to the world.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Self-Centeredness Problem "
    content: "Kaiser warned against self-centeredness, self-care or the idea of loving
      yourself taking too far. He remarked on the issue:\r\n\r\n\u201CSelf-centeredness
      is retarded concept led by fatfuckers, LGBT movements or other idiots that
      attempt to justify its laziness and immobility towards greatness. Hiding behind
      its identity and its inferiority is the epitome of a person who is incapable
      of change. Locking people\u2019s true potentiality. People who don\u2019t build
      sufficient feedback loops to correct itself; not being in anxiety and stays
      in the status quo of mediocrity will be drown in their own biases, world view
      confined to their own views and an echo chamber. This echo chamber that exists
      within a community is devil\u2019s circle that can worsened biases, leaving
      permanent flawed idea of pattern ingrained to their own brain for the rest
      of their life. Similar to addictions.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor the Kaiser, balancing
      between individualism and communitarian is important. In line with Social-Capitalism,
      Kaiser believes that self-centeredness must in the right balance so that individuality
      can be retained while criticism can be used to improve one\u2019s self and
      to be better in retrospective of one\u2019s self. The realm of the metaphysics
      and the materialist must be balanced.\r\n\r\nThe American ideology has a major
      flaw in that it posits individuality and freedom as its main tenet for its
      achievements and prosperity however this is greatly misleading. The real advantage
      of the United States is complex society, emergence and individual\u2019s ability
      to do anything without much social constraints hence: ability to see one thing
      from another perspective. United States\u2019 highly varied types of individuals
      and stable economy allowed for innovation and systematic feedback loop that
      constantly iterates and fixes its mistakes. \r\n\r\nOn the other side, country
      like China, South Korea, Japan and Vietnam grows into great economic power
      thanks its unified homogenous population and lack of different ethnics. The
      communitarian nature of those countries eliminates trivial problems in the
      bottom matters and focuses on the greater things, hence you cannot innovate
      or do anything if basic things left untreated. However, the big constraint
      of those country is that its potentiality will be limited especially cultural
      homogenization caused inability to see things from the other perspective, thus
      slowing rate of change and innovation. The center of the ideology in those
      communitarian country is communitarianism, different from individual liberty
      of the American ideology.\r\n\r\nThe self-centeredness individuality of American
      ideology has caused American fall into the spell of the metaphysics realm rather
      than materialistic realm which the false consciousness was shaped by materialistic
      things itself. US\u2019 \u2018fatfuckers\u2019 according to Kaiser and its
      red tapes has caused them to be sapped from actual real productive works and
      focuses on the unnecessaries. Money could be spent on real productive things
      was instead: spent on food and healthcare.\r\n\r\n\u201CProblems that never
      existed, becomes exists. An emergence of problems. Problems will create itself.\u201D\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Repressed Consciousness of the Masses '
    content: "In a society, everyone has their own repressed negative behaviours
      in order to keep the harmony society in tact however a pattern will emerge
      hence that common repressed behaviour is the \u2018repressed consciousness\u2019.
      \r\n\r\nFrom many studies, it is showed that many people desire a group sex
      or interchangeable sexual partners but the legacy system of the old society
      prevented people to conduct such behaviour or action. In Sixtus, polyamory
      is the most common type of relationship, people able to conduct casual sex
      with many people without significant consequences. Sixtusian society had reorganized
      itself to bring a total \u2018destruction\u2019 of its conventional and conservative
      relationship structure. The old family structure of 1 man and 1 wife is a legacy
      system that had been \u2018purged\u2019. Many have argued the change was primarily
      caused by economic system and societal reforms. The total liberation of repressed
      desires of the masses enabled Sixtus to do many things that other societies
      can\u2019t, gaining a major comparative advantage; a country that is different
      from the others will invoke niche interest, a unique opportunity.\r\n\r\nBefore
      Kaiser\u2019s rise, the hikikomori (Japanese term for being confined; severe
      social withdrawal) was common amongst Sixtusian youth however Kaiser launched
      the Totalitarian Youth and \u201CSend-Down Youth\u201D programs which radically
      eliminates many socially isolated young people. Kaiser rejected that socially
      isolated people are incapable of social activities or physically/mentally inferior,
      Kaiser believed some social ethics and rules were too restrictive; Kaiser argues
      it will damage people\u2019s confidence and especially it strengthens the division
      between ethnics, races or cultures hence people retreat to the caves, becomes
      isolated, refuse to meddle in ridiculous matters. he remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CA
      na\xEFve person must be clashed with reality and they must dragged out from
      their homes. Introducing an artificial boundary or wrong type of consciousness
      will lead a person to their doom. You tell them X and obey to it because the
      society told you to do it. You have been dictated by the dictatorship of the
      masses. Mass society has successfully reduced you into an NPC, a generic pathetic
      people.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is unacceptable that we have turned like this.
      There must some kind of rejuvenation of the spirit. People are isolated becoming
      easy to divide and conquer. Becoming capitalist\u2019 prey. The youth was given
      the false, wrong consciousness, materialistic things to distract them from
      becoming the greatest version of one\u2019s self. They give you stupid entertainment
      and false political movement: they give you the rainbow flag, the socialist,
      conservative, the Islamist, even the Sixtusian flag and whatever which turned
      you into an NPC. Becoming the worst of yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\nSocially isolated
      people are argued by Kaiser being led into the worst version of one\u2019s
      self. They lay down at home, becoming lazy, unproductive and unhealthy. When
      these type of people becoming a lot, there will be a repressed consciousness
      shared amongst hikikomori. These hikikomori can be weaponized if handled well
      according to the Kaiser: \r\n\r\n\u201CThere are a million of socially isolated
      people and \u2018degenerate\u2019 people. An unused, idle people waiting to
      be mobilized. I simply cannot have idle people do nothing hence they must dragged
      out from their homes. Joining the Totalitarian Youth will rejuvenate them.
      Without doubt the retarded progressive movement and conformist behaviour has
      isolated many young people hence I will pit these two in the gladiator arena
      to fight each other. A net good. For the socially isolated people as they will
      be resuscitated into a fresh, functional citizen. For me, the political circus,
      \u2018filibustering\u2019 of the progressives is dead.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo
      longer they became the retards of society. Instead, they all became the greatest
      version of themselves. The beasts have been unleashed.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiberation
      and shatter the rules of conformity allowed for social liberation. The people
      no longer stuck in a gridlock where they are able to express themselves. While
      the gender movement self-proclaims itself as freedom of expression, Kaiser
      rejected these claim as a distortion and only creates unnecessary societal
      complexity which creates a lot rules which then made people becomes reluctant
      to engage social behaviour. By reducing and crushing complex identity to one
      (as in military), people are much communitarian, easy to understand each other.
      But Kaiser\u2019s support for complex society meant crushing identity must
      only be temporary as reducing complexity of a society will reduce innovation
      and hamper Uberwelt. The pursue of temporarily reducing identity is to enable
      social cohesion and understanding to prevent social frictions.\r\n\r\nThe example
      of repressed consciousness of the masses: during a major racial protest, white
      progressives\u2019 people in the United States bows and beg forgiveness to
      African American for the slavery and discrimination, giving their sympathy
      towards the black movements however a year after it happened, some questioned
      the sincerity of it and why they do it. Or in some places like the church or
      in Indonesia, a phenomenon where people become suddenly possessed by demons.\r\n\r\nAccording
      to the Kaiser, these two are the blatant example of the hidden spirit of the
      people: the victim mentality. The white people \u2018progressives\u2019 had
      these victim mentality in which they believed the whites were colonizers and
      must be blamed for all of the problem in the world. The possessed by \u2018demons\u2019
      Indonesians had the same victim mentality: to unchain themselves from a conformist,
      communitarian society which is putting them under pressure to constantly maintain
      their social relations, norms, ethics and codes. By possessing \u2018themselves
      to the demons\u2019, it is an opportunity to induce a \u2018good trauma\u2019
      which is to release their repressed feelings of being under social pressure.
      They cry themselves or using justification of \u2018demon possession\u2019
      because sometimes it is the easy way out, to turn him/herself as a victim rather
      than ideologically pure and believes in its very actions.\r\n\r\nPeople will
      have these \u2018repressed feelings\u2019 and \u2018wants\u2019, increasingly
      grew larger under the nose. An example like: group sex or mass sex but cannot
      due to societal restrictions. Its sexual feelings were emitted by their own
      \u2018animal instincts\u2019, their brain or addiction to something (mind fixation/brain
      rot). Eventually over time, it will slowly liberated.\r\n\r\nDeep, hidden,
      repressed consciousness of the masses can be expressed to a video game, movies
      and a piece of entertainment that hasn\u2019t existed yet. What does this mean?
      A movie or video game can blow up and success if it resonates with masses and
      no other media had the likes of it. Many people might have a common repressed
      desire of some things. By creating a piece of media that fulfil these desires
      will cure many of the people\u2019s problems and ailments.\r\n"
