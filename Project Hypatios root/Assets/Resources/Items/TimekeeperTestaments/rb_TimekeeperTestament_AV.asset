  - chapterName: Uberwelt/Superculture
    content: "Uberwelt or Superior Culture, is one of Kaiser\u2019s ideological justification
      for Sixtusian imperialism and expansionism. Uberwelt are aimed to make a melting
      pot culture that takes elements from many cultures with the ultimate goal is
      to make a highly saturated colorful society comprised of many ethnics, race
      and religions which can make the society more complex, emergence mechanics
      and to expand the \u2018greater entity\u2019 of civilization. These are all
      ties to Sixtusian Empire main ideology of Social-Capitalism which by establishing
      a society with greater complexity will have the possibility of liberating the
      workforce.\r\n\r\nThe anti-conservative culture of Sixtus is primarily stemmed
      of Safarian race 900 years (from 1000 AD -1900 AD) of cultural and technological
      stagnation primarily caused by Elistar Empire impose a peace in Safar through
      Eltravivor Empire as its proxy state. The Elven race has manipulated the geopolitics
      of Safar into an eternal perpetual war between Salatan and Eltravivor Empire
      as it becomes a somewhat an entertainment for the Elven. The gridlock situation
      was finally broken with rise of Social-Capitalism and Communitarianism movements
      in the 19th century. Both of these socialist forces combined forces to launch
      independence movements against Eltravivor, culminating in War of the End from
      1967-1975 which ended up with then Sixtusian forces launched a large-scale
      systematic genocide against the Eltravivor from 1975-1984 for being \u2018traitor
      for the Safarian race\u2019.\r\n\r\nThe socialist movement of Safarian race
      in the 19th century was noted with an incredible amount of luck, mass organization
      and the ability to repulse against Elistar & Eltravivor Empire. It is revealed
      that Machine of Madness was taken away by the Eltravivor Empire in 1901 which
      afterwards, the coordination and movement of the rebels became way less efficient
      and more disorganized. This meant some Timekeeper in the end of the 19th century,
      has successfully coordinate movements to launch an inevitable doom for the
      Eltravivor Empire.\r\n\r\nTo achieve the superculture or Uberwelt, it is to
      build a superior culture that recognizes the need of letting pockets of society
      exists with every group has its own purpose, interest and behavior however
      it needs a holistic narrative, a cohesiveness of the entire people where all
      agreed to some universal values, in Sixtusian case: liberate the workforce
      and delegate it to the machineries. By creating a grand narrative, it can greatly
      distract menial differences between contrasting cultures and focus on greater
      goals.\r\n\r\nHowever, Kaiser\u2019s ideological quest of liberating the workforce
      are halted by the feudalistic system of the UDE, Elistar, Alpha and the strong
      conservative religions. The UDE, Elistar and Alpha has been highly resistant
      against Sixtusian reform from semi-feudal to social-capitalism as it threatens
      destabilization and handed power to the masses. Kaiser argued feudalism while
      allows stability for centuries and reduce chaos, it prevents innovation and
      desaturate the color of society. Kaiser noted that Serfdom, slavery and caste
      are systems that will return if technology and societal changes were slow as
      it will make rulers to pursue materialistic things via conquest rather than
      expend its capital to develop its education and researching new innovations.
      \r\n\r\nOn one example, Sixtusian heavy influence on Earth meant its ideology
      started permeated to Earth. It then greatly clashed with many conservative
      religions especially Islam. Sixtusian\u2019 ultra-progressive society with
      its LGBT, secularism and liberalism becomes a point of contention for many
      religions on Earth. Pahliv Aul Said being a Timekeeper took an advantage of
      this and exploit it by moderating as the only person able to balance between
      implementing Sixtusian technology while retaining old Islamic values against
      Sixtusian Uberwelt influence which argued attempt to wipe the cultures of Earth.
      It then caused more significant problem by declaring the caliphate movement
      to overthrow the Sixtusian out from Earth. \r\n\r\nWhen asked about the problem
      of religions shortly after the fall of the Caliphate:\r\n\r\n\u201CI hate these
      retarded Caliphate that self-proclaims itself as an \u2018repressed\u2019 noble
      \u2018Jihadist\u2019 defender of the faith to protect itself from so-called
      scary \u2018progressive\u2019 society with LGBT, atheism and secularism. Idiots
      chanted to evict the alien Sixtusian Empire out from Earth. These shithole
      Islamic movement attempting to desaturate the color of society and crushing
      the complexity of society. All wears white or black clothes, forcing women
      to wear shitty Burqa black \u2018ninja-shinobi\u2019 clothes. Intellectualism
      are crushed, demagogue Islamic politicians uses the damn holy book all the
      time as the populist instrument to control the masses, unbelievers are persecuted,
      anything that is incompatible with their religion will be persecuted. But thank
      God, Pahliv Aul Said is at the very least, attempted to launch bi\u2019dah
      or reformation/innovation like the Christianity with its Protestant revolution.
      And don\u2019t even get me started with any of the \u2018revivalist\u2019 movement.
      Hermeneutics analyzer interpret religious texts or any political book and twist
      the narrative with mental gymnastics to whatever they like to build a new religious
      revivalist movement to \u2018go back to its roots\u2019. Revisionist idiots!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
      Sixtusian Empire has practically absorbed every value and tradition of all
      cultures. Even taking junk values and useless superstition. Kaiser, even though
      pragmatic, secular and doesn\u2019t believe in any superstition remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CSuperstition
      works even though you don\u2019t believe it.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe explained that
      superstition works for traditionalist, cultural preservation which added the
      absurdism value in a culture. This absurd, seemingly useless superstition belief
      can act as a potential low-entry barrier interaction for connection with people,
      a shared value amongst differing cultures. Without the superstition or any
      of the values absorbed, there will be a situation where two very differing
      cultures will inevitably be clashed together greatly then it will fall into
      a great war. Absorption of trivial things was needed to adopt and understanding
      the culture of other and eventually, supersede the old inferior culture.\r\n\r\nTo
      establish a healthy culture, Kaiser issues a mandate that every citizen must
      engage in the third place (community place) every week for at least 2 hours,
      any places including bars, cafes, community centers or parks. Failing to commit
      104 hours of \u2018community time\u2019 or any \u2018social service\u2019 in
      a year will impose an income tax of 5% and some perks removed for the following
      year.\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Repression of Progressives\u2019 Political Consciousness "
    content: "Upon Kaiser\u2019s rise to power, Sixtusian ultra-progressive society
      are poising a major threat to Kaiser\u2019s imperialist ambitions. To shut
      down the oppositions, Kaiser employed the Totalitarian Youth to crush the influence
      and repress the political movements of the liberals, ultra left socialists
      and progressives. The accusation that Kaiser is anti-LGBT, TERF or anti-liberals
      by the progressives is blatantly wrong rather his totalitarianism style rule
      equally repress every single political movement including the conservatives,
      LGBT, any religion, ethnics and race. Instead, Kaiser was not a dogmatist ideological
      vanguard, he rather takes any policies from every political ideology can help
      to raise the empire quickly.\r\n\r\nThe early era of his rule, Kaiser\u2019s
      primary objective is to remove the strong influence of Sixtusian LGBT politics
      in order to shift focus on space imperialism, militarism and social-capitalism.
      He sees it as more of distraction and holding back Kaiser\u2019s goals. He
      not only sees progressivism a distraction but also the others:\r\n\r\n\u201CIslamic
      cultures are repressing intellectualism and secularism on Earth. Combined with
      its rapid population growth, it is a cancer that needs to be eliminated through
      chemotherapy. Some \u2018good\u2019 cells will die and some \u2018bad\u2019
      cells will die.\u201D\r\n\r\nSixtus has developed into a polyamory society
      where children are shared, family structure is non-existent and everyone can
      have consensual sexual relationships without any constraints. Sixtusian nuclear
      family structure was unsustainable beginning from its inception, then The War
      for the End from 1967 to 1975 is the final nail in the coffin that led to the
      destruction of conservatism in Sixtus and the rise of progressvism. Since then,
      the polyamory movement takes off which enabled overlapping ownership of a child.
      At the current stats, over 60% people currently claim in a polyamory relationship.\r\n\r\nAs
      a consequence of this, selling a child was common. Abortion was rampant and
      the lack of strong bonding meant the child usually sold to the government.
      When the sold child if not adopted, it will be under \u2018government-care\u2019
      until it reached 17 years old. \r\n\r\nKaiser called Sixtus a \u2018progressive
      liberal nightmare\u2019 and possess \u2018the most disgusting society system\u2019
      but Kaiser\u2019s antagonism towards Sixtus\u2019 ultra-progressive society
      was largely muted due to his vanguardist stance of Social-Capitalism\u2019
      \u2018liberating the workforce\u2019 tenet in that, Sixtusian society has become
      more productive by destroying its conservative family structure, become polyamorous
      and the torn down of \u2018Berlin Wall\u2019 of family structure. The breakdown
      of conservative social values allows unique economic activities that is not
      seen in other countries. This caused comparative advantage and innovation,
      which the Kaiser absolutely needed to raise the empire:\r\n\r\n\u201CWe gain
      money by doing what the other not doing.\u201D\r\n\r\nDespite his anti-progressivism,
      nevertheless Kaiser disliked the idea of where the family structure wall is
      strong but the parents only having one child, he remarks:\r\n\r\n\u201CHaving
      one child, is worst for the parent and worst for the child but the best for
      capitalists. No siblings and parent overreliance on one child. By stripping
      the family, the child will be in alienated and isolation hence easily manipulated
      by the mass society. For me, the dynamic of both family and mass society must
      equal and balanced.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn the matter of LGBT according to the Kaiser,
      LGBT radicalism in Sixtusian Empire is primarily caused by social constructionism
      that had beneficial for heterosexual, so LGBT people are disadvantaged people
      who revolts against the system. For some, being an LGBT or creating of one\u2019s
      gender is to find one\u2019s true identity. However, the Kaiser utterly opposed
      the philosophy of LGBT of \u2018finding true identity and gender\u2019, he
      believes that \u2018existence precedes essence\u2019 in that one becomes influenced
      more by the environment. He remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CI don\u2019t like this ridiculous
      notion of \u2018I have found my true identity and gender\u2019. I found people
      who attempts to reorient its sexual orientation were taken into too much into
      the metaphysical realm and abandoning the materialist/real world by rejecting
      introspection of one\u2019s self. They become detached from reality that they
      became biased of their own making.\u201D\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Self-Centeredness Problem "
    content: "Kaiser disliked the idea of self-centeredness, self-care or the idea
      of loving yourself. He remarked on the issue:\r\n\r\n\u201CSelf-centeredness
      is retarded concept led by fatfuckers, LGBT movements or other idiots that
      attempt to justify its laziness and immobility towards greatness. Hiding behind
      its identity and its inferiority is the epitome of a person who is incapable
      of change. People who don\u2019t build sufficient feedback loops to correct
      itself; not being in anxiety and stays in the status quo of mediocrity will
      be drown in their own biases, world view confined to their own views and an
      echo chamber.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHence, this echo chamber that exists within
      these community is devil\u2019s circle that can worsened biases, leaving permanent
      flawed idea to their own brain to the point when you\u2019re an adult, you
      cannot grasp new concept and idea anymore.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor the Kaiser, balancing
      between individualism and communitarian is important. In line with Social-Capitalism,
      Kaiser believes that self-centeredness must in the right balance so that individuality
      can be retained while criticism can be used to improve one\u2019s self and
      to be better in retrospective of one\u2019s self. The realm of the metaphysics
      and the materialist must be balanced.\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Repressed Consciousness of the Masses '
    content: "In a society, everyone has their own repressed negative behaviours
      in order to keep the harmony society in tact however a pattern will emerge
      hence that common repressed behaviour is the \u2018repressed consciousness\u2019.
      \r\n\r\nFrom many studies, it is showed that many people like group sex or
      interchangeable sexual partners but the legacy system of the old society prevented
      people to conduct such behaviour or action. In Sixtus, polyamory is the most
      common type of relationship, people able to conduct casual sex with many people
      without significant consequences. The total liberation of repressed desires
      of the masses enabled Sixtus to do many things that other societies can\u2019t,
      gaining a major comparative and competitive advantages. \r\n\r\nSixtusian society
      had reorganized itself to bring a total \u2018destruction\u2019 of its conventional
      and conservative relationship structure. The old family structure of 1 man
      and 1 wife is a legacy system that had been \u2018purged\u2019. Many have argued
      the change was primarily caused by economic system and societal reforms.\r\n\r\nKaiser
      had numerous warnings to any countries that attempt to adopt highly advanced
      Sixtusian technology while staunchly defend its cultures and not adopting Sixtus\u2019
      social-capitalism society structure:\r\n\r\n\u201CTo steal our technology is
      easy but to innovate from scratch while retaining your pathetic culture and
      way of thinking is impossible. The Sixtusian able to rise this fast only because
      it liberated the repressed consciousness of the masses. If you do not liberate
      it, then you will only cause false consciousness; a misalignment and disconnection
      with reality.\u201D\r\n\r\nBefore Kaiser\u2019s rise, the hikikomori (Japanese
      term for being confined; severe social withdrawal) was common amongst Sixtusian
      youth however Kaiser launched the Totalitarian Youth and \u201CSend-Down Youth\u201D
      programs which radically eliminates many socially isolated young people. Kaiser
      rejected that socially isolated people are incapable of social activities or
      physically/mentally inferior, Kaiser much more believed that these people were
      simply brought onto the wrong consciousness that is damaging to these people,
      he remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CA na\xEFve person must be clashed with reality and
      they must dragged out from their homes. Introducing an artificial boundary
      or wrong type of consciousness will lead a person to their doom. You tell them
      X and obey to it because the society told you to do it. You have dictated by
      the dictatorship of the masses. Mass society has successfully reduced you into
      an NPC, a generic pathetic people.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is unacceptable that
      we have turned like this. When the big people make mistakes, you the pathetic
      one must grind your face to the asphalt road. There must some kind of rejuvenation
      of the spirit. People are isolated becoming easy to divide and conquer. Becoming
      capitalist\u2019 prey. The youth was given the wrong consciousness, a materialistic
      consciousness to distract them from becoming the greatest version of one\u2019s
      self. They give you stupid entertainment and false political movement, becoming
      the worst of yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\nSocially isolated people are argued by
      Kaiser being led into the worst version of one\u2019s self. They lay down at
      home, becoming lazy, unproductive and unhealthy. When these type of people
      becoming a lot, there will be a repressed consciousness shared amongst hikikomori.
      These hikikomori can be weaponized if handled well according to the Kaiser:
      \r\n\r\n\u201CThere are a million of socially isolated people and \u2018degenerate\u2019
      people. An unused, idle people waiting to be mobilized. I simply cannot have
      idle people do nothing hence they must dragged out from their homes. Joining
      the Totalitarian Youth will rejuvenate them. Without doubt the retarded progressive
      movement and conformist behaviour has isolated many young people hence I will
      pit these two in the gladiator arena to fight each other. A net good. For the
      socially isolated people as they will be resuscitated into a fresh, functional
      citizen. For me, the political circus, \u2018filibustering\u2019 of the progressives
      is dead.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo longer they became the retards of society. Instead,
      they all became the greatest version of themselves. The beasts have been unleashed.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiberation
      and shatter the rules of conformity allowed for social liberation. The people
      no longer stuck in a gridlock where they are able to express themselves. While
      the gender movement self-proclaims itself as freedom of expression, Kaiser
      rejected these claim as a distortion and only creates unnecessary societal
      complexity which creates a lot rules which then made people becomes reluctant
      to engage social behaviour. By reducing and crushing complex identity to one
      (as in military), people are much communitarian, easy to understand each other.
      But in line of Kaiser\u2019s support for complex society, he noted crushing
      identity must only be temporary as reducing complexity of a society will reduce
      innovation.\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Eternal Stage of Social-Capitalism '
    content: "The primary premise of Social-Capitalism is that it assumes a country
      will stuck in an eternal stage of shifting between centralization and decentralization
      policies. It assumes the importance of both welfarism and centralization of
      wealth to the ruling class. The idea of accumulation of wealth is good because
      it can concentrate the wealth to create some projects which can potentially
      benefits the masses. Meanwhile the idea of distributing wealth is good because
      it allows small people to contribute society\u2019s complex system to have
      adaption, feedback loops and emergence which can innovate.\r\n\r\nThe Sixtusian
      Empire is the only empire that adheres to this ideology. Other empires like
      Elistar, United Dionary Empire, Alpha Empire which has existed for thousands
      of years all developed into semi-feudalist empire with caste system and strong
      separation of classes. This is because feudalist structure allows high stability
      at the cost weak reforms and low innovation. The caste system allows for highly
      efficient society which the labour is properly divided from one\u2019s birth.
      With this, the Elistar, UDE and Alpha has practically turned its working class
      to a total alienation where they all has lost the ability determine to its
      own life and destiny.\r\n\r\nWhen the UDE lost the War of the Universe in 2036,
      the Sixtusian Empire forced the UDE to open up its economy and rapidly introduced
      new machinery which fundamentally changed UDE\u2019s social-economic structure
      to social-capitalism, causing a massive chaos. Sixtusian reforms to UDE\u2019s
      economy is using Dionarian as their cheap labourers while the Sixtusian gradually
      becomes the capitalists, dictate the goods to be produced, hence liberating
      Sixtusian\u2019 workforce. These had major consequences.\r\n\r\nFirst, Sixtusian
      forces all UDE\u2019s subject states to major land reforms. UDE subjects that
      were republics or had high liberty are fundamentally unchanged by this policy
      but monarchy-like subject states which are the dominant government form of
      many UDE\u2019s subjects quickly fall into chaos. The unrealistic high targets
      issued by Sixtusian government to UDE monarchy-like subject state was unable
      to keep up. The enforcement by the Sixtusian Outerboundary to the local ruling
      class were brutal and when the local rulers successfully met Sixtusian\u2019
      demands usually met with a revolt by the lower class of Dionarians against
      their landlords and aristocrat classes. Some places Dionarian launched massive
      classicide against the upper class, causing the Sixtusian Outerboundary to
      forcibly take control of the vacant government.\r\n"
