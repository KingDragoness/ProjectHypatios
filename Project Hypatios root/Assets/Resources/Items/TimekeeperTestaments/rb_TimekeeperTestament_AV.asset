  - chapterName: Uberwelt/Superculture
    content: "Uberwelt or Superior Culture, is one of Kaiser\u2019s ideological justification
      for Sixtusian imperialism and expansionism. Uberwelt are aimed to make a melting
      pot culture that takes elements from many cultures with the ultimate goal is
      to make a new \u2018saturated colorful\u2019 society comprised from many ethnics,
      race and religions which can make the society more complex, emergence mechanics
      and to expand the \u2018greater entity\u2019 of civilization. The reality of
      Uberwelt however, is to expand the Sixtusian Empire and somewhat ties to its
      main ideology of Social-Capitalism which by establishing a society with greater
      complexity will have the possibility of liberating the workforce.\r\n\r\nThe
      anti-conservative culture of Sixtus is primarily stemmed of Safarian race 900
      years (from 1000 AD -1900 AD) of cultural and technological stagnation primarily
      caused by Elistar Empire impose anti-progression policy in Safar through Eltravivor
      Empire as its proxy state. The Elven race has manipulated the geopolitics of
      Safar into an eternal perpetual war between Salatan and Eltravivor Empire as
      it becomes a somewhat an entertainment and an experiment for the Elven. The
      gridlock situation was finally broken with rise of Social-Capitalism and Communitarianism
      movements in the 19th century with both of these destroyed Eltravivor in War
      of the End from 1967-1975 which ended up in a Sixtusian large-scale systematic
      genocide against the Eltravivor from 1975-1984 for being \u2018traitor for
      the Safarian race\u2019. With the fall of Eltravivor, Sixtus becomes one of
      the great powers in Safar and turns into the most culturally progressive and
      diverse country in Safar.\r\n\r\nUberwelt main objective is to build a superior
      culture that taking elements from all major cultures, religions, ethnics and
      race. However, in reality, Sixtusian Uberwelt is only a set dressing for establishing
      Sixtus as a superpower social-capitalist state, it is the equivalent of United
      States\u2019 false promise of \u2018American Dream\u2019, individualism and
      freedom. The practice and reality of the Uberwelt is not peaceful coexistence
      of multiple cultures but it is to merge all culture in the world into one \u2018universally\u2019
      accepted culture which this new culture has resolve every conflict with each
      other. With it, the new culture resolves all conflicts and people can focus
      on greater goals (like liberate the workforce and productivity) rather than
      be distracted on \u2018stupid\u2019 trivial, religious matters.\r\n\r\nKaiser
      concerned when culture refused to infuse new ideas. There are two spectrums
      of cultural diversity: homogeneous (one-dominant culture) and heterogeneous
      (multiculturalism). Each has its own advantages and disadvantages:\r\n\r\n\u201CMulticulturalism
      and multi-ethnic state are a major problem in that no one is unified. Idiot
      ultra-progressives chanted multiculturalism. This \u2018united in diversity\u2019
      is absolutely retarded, if people with different values and ethics lived in
      a neighborhood, they will not be unified. Instead, they will build walls. This
      is especially true when the two cultures never reached consensus and its conflicts
      left unresolved.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI think it is absolute insanity for Earth,
      in Europe to be precise, that they haven\u2019t resolve the cultural conflict
      between Islam and secularism but they decided to grab immigrants to the country.
      This reckless and a complete madness!\u201D\r\n\r\nKaiser faced with major
      problems of heterogeneous society on attempting to put people of different
      cultures living on the same neighborhood: the rise of ambiguity and opaqueness.
      The opaqueness is the big problem in that a person from certain religion can
      uses their \u2018religion card trick\u2019 to avoid working long hours or avoid
      doing some tasks/ actions. The big hypocrite of multicultural state like Indonesia
      or United States, is that de jure, they proclaim the diversity but the de facto
      is that people will do absolutely anything to comprise a team that is strictly
      similar hence the \u2018stereotypes races\u2019 of professions. Common misconception
      is that people thinks is that having people of different ethnics, race and
      culture is \u2018totally sustainable\u2019, Kaiser said:\r\n\r\n\u201CPeople
      likes to think that it is possible to make three cultures exists together.
      This is madness. No cultures can exist together without either breaking apart
      or extinct/absorbed. Two contrasting differing values of different religions
      will absolutely conflict. If you fail to resolve this, it will keep getting
      bigger until it explodes into an inevitable war, either war in 10 years or
      war in 100 years.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, culture itself can be an ambiguity.
      It is a very vague and blurred line. The big problem is that culture can encapsulate
      other cultures, forming a nested structure or an evolution, syncretic. A state
      with homogeneous culture does not form because of external threats, but rather
      the lack of it. Heterogeneous tends to form thanks to external threats hence
      people are much likely to unified there is a constant external threat. With
      a heterogeneous country, a bigger culture forms to main theme of example: \u2018the
      Other who wants to destroys all of us\u2019. Kaiser argues heterogeneous country
      cannot survive in an era of peace, at all. Different people can only unite
      if there\u2019s a greater threat beyond. It is during peace does a country
      under went homogenization:\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is a great paradox of peace. If
      you went to peace and you are the top of the world, there will be people started
      fighting each other for whose culture (country\u2019s subculture) will be dominant.
      With the process, over time, there will be homogenization. If resist homogenization,
      there will be a civil war.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe advantage of a homogeneous country
      is undisputed: cultures were much more unified, its values were similar and
      rituals were similar, stability is guaranteed, no room for \u2018corruption\u2019
      and the error is smaller. While highly efficient and easily mobilizable, it
      has major flaw: it has potentiality limits and inability to see things from
      multiple perspective. Heterogeneous society on the other hand has a much greater
      potential. Complex society allows for emergence and mixing other cultures altogether.
      \r\n\r\nThe modern culture of South Korea and Japan has been mixed with numerous
      influences from all over Earth. It is not strictly \u2018Japanese\u2019 or
      \u2018South Korean\u2019 only. If the culture is strictly that, then both Japanese
      and South Korean culture wouldn\u2019t gotten this strong. Kaiser noted Indonesia
      had a huge potential culture that needs to be mixed influences from the West
      and presented in a modern, contemporary style narrative or else it cannot spread
      itself naturally. Both Chinese and Indonesian culture suffers from what Kaiser
      called \u2018Western Exoticism Fetishes\u2019 in that it is not treated as
      \u2018modern\u2019 but rather cultural preservation UNESCO thingy with failing
      to attract modern kids while only \u2018boomers\u2019 had attraction to it.
      The moment a kid or teenager successfully attracted to a culture like Japanese
      and South Korean culture then it is a successful cultural export.\r\n\r\nKaiser\u2019s
      ideological quest of Uberwelt is halted by the feudalistic system of the UDE,
      Elistar, Alpha and the strong conservative religions. The UDE, Elistar and
      Alpha has been highly resistant against Sixtusian reform from semi-feudal to
      social-capitalism as it threatens destabilization and handed power to the masses.
      Kaiser had stubbornly attempting to injecting social-capitalism system to all
      over the galaxy. While feudalism allows stability for centuries and reduce
      chaos, Kaiser argues it prevents innovation and desaturate the color of society.
      Kaiser noted that Serfdom, slavery and caste are systems that will return if
      technology and societal changes were slow as it will make rulers to pursue
      materialistic things via conquest rather than expend its capital to develop
      its education and researching new innovations. \r\n\r\nOn one example, Sixtusian
      heavy influence on Earth meant its ideology started permeated to Earth. It
      then greatly clashed with many conservative religions especially Islam. Sixtusian\u2019
      ultra-progressive society with its LGBT, secularism and liberalism becomes
      a point of contention for many religions on Earth. For the West and secular
      states, it wasn\u2019t problem but it is the Islamic world where it become
      a major problem thanks to its radical orthodoxy. Pahliv Aul Said being a Timekeeper
      took an advantage of this and exploit it by moderating as the only person able
      to balance between the new Sixtusian values and old Islamic values. He was
      against Sixtusian Uberwelt influence which argued attempt to wipe the cultures
      of Earth. It then caused more significant problem by declaring the caliphate
      movement to overthrow the Sixtusian out from Earth. \r\n\r\nWhen asked about
      the problem of religions shortly after the fall of the Caliphate:\r\n\r\n\u201CI
      hate these retarded Caliphate that self-proclaims itself as an \u2018repressed\u2019
      noble \u2018Jihadist\u2019 defender of the faith to protect itself from so-called
      scary \u2018progressive\u2019 society with LGBT, atheism and secularism. Idiots
      chanted to evict the alien Sixtusian Empire out from Earth. These shithole
      Islamic movement attempting to desaturate the color of society and crushing
      the complexity of society. All wears white or black clothes, forcing women
      to wear shitty Burqa black \u2018ninja-shinobi\u2019 clothes. Intellectualism
      are crushed, demagogue Islamic politicians uses the damn holy book all the
      time as the populist instrument to control the masses, unbelievers are persecuted,
      anything that is incompatible with their religion will be persecuted. And don\u2019t
      even get me started with any of the \u2018revivalist\u2019 movement. Hermeneutics
      analyzer interpret religious texts or any political book and twist the narrative
      with mental gymnastics to whatever they like to build a new religious revivalist
      movement to \u2018go back to its roots\u2019. Revivalists idiots!\u201D\r\n\r\nUberwelt
      basically dictated that even taking junk values and useless superstition will
      be beneficial. Kaiser, even though pragmatic, secular and doesn\u2019t believe
      in any superstition remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CSuperstition works even though you
      don\u2019t believe it.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe explained that superstition works for
      traditionalist, cultural preservation which added the absurdism value in a
      culture like a joke. This absurd, seemingly useless superstition belief can
      act as a potential low-entry barrier interaction for connection with people,
      a shared value amongst differing cultures. Superstition tends to be an easy
      funny cultural exchange, some kind of universality. Absorption of trivial things
      was needed to adopt and understanding the culture of other and eventually,
      supersede the old inferior culture.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Repression of Progressives\u2019 Political Consciousness "
    content: "Upon Kaiser\u2019s rise to power, Sixtusian ultra-progressive society
      are poising a major threat to Kaiser\u2019s imperialist ambitions. To shut
      down the oppositions, Kaiser employed the Totalitarian Youth to crush the influence
      and repress the political movements of the liberals, ultra left socialists
      and progressives. Kaiser\u2019s totalitarianism style meant he needs to equally
      represses every single political movement that is not in line of his movement
      including the conservatives, LGBT, any religion, ethnics and race. Kaiser was
      not a dogmatist ideological vanguard, he rather is a pragmatic and takes any
      policies from every political ideology that can help to raise the empire quickly.
      Kaiser\u2019s early rule primary objective is to remove the strong influence
      of Sixtusian progressivism, LGBT politics in order to shift focus on space
      imperialism, militarism and social-capitalism. He sees it as more of distraction
      and holding back Kaiser\u2019s goals. He not only sees progressivism a distraction
      but also the others:\r\n\r\n\u201CIslamic cultures are repressing intellectualism
      and secularism on Earth. Combined with its rapid population growth, it is a
      cancer that needs to be eliminated through chemotherapy. Some \u2018good\u2019
      cells will die and some \u2018bad\u2019 cells will die.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor the
      Kaiser, it is utterly unrealistic that a country must bow to the progressives.
      He called progressives were \u2018overly revolutionary\u2019 in that their
      attempt to destroy the social constructivism by the heterosexuals, they also
      attempted to destroy the underlying systems that were barely connected to it.
      He parallels it to the proletariat communist revolution of being \u2018revolutionary
      fetishism\u2019 or dismantling too many systems at once.\r\n\r\nKaiser called
      Sixtus a \u2018progressive liberal nightmare\u2019 and possess \u2018the most
      disgusting society system\u2019 but Kaiser\u2019s antagonism towards Sixtus\u2019
      ultra-progressive society was largely muted due to his vanguardist stance of
      Social-Capitalism\u2019 \u2018liberating the workforce\u2019 tenet in that,
      Sixtusian society has become more productive by destroying its conservative
      family structure, become polyamorous and the torn down of \u2018Great Rigid
      Wall\u2019 of family structure. The breakdown of conservative social values
      allows unique economic activities that is not seen in other countries. This
      caused comparative advantage and innovation, which the Kaiser absolutely needed
      to raise the empire:\r\n\r\n\u201CWe gain money by doing what the other not
      doing.\u201D\r\n\r\nSixtusian society has developed into a polyamory society
      where children are shared, family structure is non-existent and everyone can
      have consensual sexual relationships without any constraints. Sixtusian nuclear
      family structure was unsustainable beginning from its inception, then The War
      for the End from 1967 to 1975 is the final nail in the coffin that led to the
      destruction of conservatism in Sixtus and the rise of progressivism. Since
      then, the polyamory movement takes off which enabled overlapping ownership
      of a child. At the current stats, over 60% people currently claim in a polyamory
      relationship.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this, selling a child was common.
      Abortion was rampant and the lack of strong bonding meant the child usually
      sold to the government. When the sold child if not adopted, it will be under
      \u2018government-care\u2019 until it reached 17 years old. \r\n\r\nHowever,
      Kaiser ultimately prefer LGBT or polyamory parenting to exist rather than having
      no child at all or unmarried. He called childless is an absolute danger of
      the state\u2019s demographics, he remarks:\r\n\r\n\u201CHaving only a single
      child, is worst for the parent and worst for the child but the best for capitalists.
      No siblings meant parent\u2019s overreliance on one child. By stripping the
      family, the child will be in alienated and isolation hence easily manipulated
      by the mass society. For me, the dynamic of both family and mass society must
      equal and balanced.\u201D\r\n\r\nLGBT radicalism in Sixtusian Empire is primarily
      caused by social constructionism that had beneficial for heterosexual, so LGBT
      people are disadvantaged people who revolts against the system. For some, being
      an LGBT or creating of one\u2019s gender is to find one\u2019s true identity.
      However, Kaiser utterly opposed the philosophy of LGBT of \u2018finding true
      identity and gender\u2019, he believes that \u2018existence precedes essence\u2019
      in that one becomes influenced more by the environment. He remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CI
      don\u2019t like this ridiculous notion of \u2018I have found my true identity
      and gender\u2019. I found people who attempts to reorient its sexual orientation
      were taken into too much into the metaphysical realm and abandoning the materialist/real
      world by rejecting introspection of one\u2019s self. They become detached from
      reality that they became biased of their own making.\u201D\r\n\r\nAn identity
      and what a person can be according to the Kaiser is malleable and tends to
      be formable. When a person declares itself as an LGBT, it is not necessarily
      always the \u2018true identity\u2019 and \u2018who I am\u2019. It is simply
      bending to the mass society\u2019s LGBT movement. Kaiser said it is no different
      than any other movements and it can obstruct the transformation process of
      a person to become the greatest version of itself or progress further down
      the line. It is in itself a social construct, invented by a group of people
      who had been disadvantaged by the world dominated of heterosexuals. For Kaiser,
      this is simply a tribe, ethnic or group of people fighting each other, progressive
      vs conservatives. The economic and political system happen to enable these
      progressive movements. In other epoch of history, this wouldn\u2019t be possible
      or even able to be conceived from anyone\u2019s imagination.\r\n\r\nThe Timekeeper
      were uniquely able to switch identities and posits itself from multiple perspective
      thanks to its time loop. Kaiser actively knows the structuralism issue that
      enforced one\u2019s identity to be confined to a certain shape set by the society.
      For this, it is all only the problem relativism and \u2018being-thrown\u2019
      in the world like a male will mostly likely confined itself to male stuffs,
      resisting it can potentially only cause additional obstacles and focuses on
      the obstacles too much, unable to progress.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s View of Religion "
    content: "For the Kaiser, people who treated religion as the emancipatory and
      enlightenment are perfectly makes sense in the context of the medieval era.
      It is unifying piece of literature with a massive cult and fanbase. The problem
      for the Kaiser however, is the treatment of it. Dogmas and written rules inside
      it were treated as the absolute rules that all of its followers must obey.
      Instructions were worded in such a way that it was like a command or a mandate
      to its followers, and worst, its followers treated it as indisputable facts
      by God that must not be crossed or disagreed. Kaiser mentioned the absurdity
      of the Muslims who attempts to behead any kafir/non-believers:\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
      is an absolute insanity that this religion still let to exist. It will be a
      thorn on our side and thereby we must flatten this religion down. One of their
      branches: Shias and Ibadi were itself were Muslim and they still get persecuted.
      If this they couldn\u2019t even have a reconciliation between themselves how
      about those, they shouted kafir? If they rule the world, they will fucking
      commit cultural genocide en masse, all obey like a hive mind creatures and
      society is like a totalitarian society and that is an absolute total destruction
      of civilization and complex society.\u201D\r\n\r\nOne thing surprising for
      the Kaiser is that he is not a staunch atheist or non-believers. Due to Kaiser\u2019s
      experience as a Timekeeper, Kaiser simply told that the things happening in
      prophets in Abrahamic religion had a possibility of being real. Kaiser refuse
      to believe nor deny its existence, he simply posits a possibility.\r\n\r\nWhen
      Kaiser controversially said he called Islam or some other religion/ideology
      as \u2018cancer that needs to be chemotherapize\u2019, he meant due to strict
      dogmas and its rabid nature can potentially destroys other cultures which reduces
      society\u2019s complexity while exacerbate its disadvantages greater. Each
      culture or ideology has its weaknesses which the existence of different cultures
      and religion must exists to cover each other weaknesses just like the division
      of labour or else it will create world of naivet\xE9s and when a disaster strikes,
      a homogeneous society of what Muslim people thinks 100% Muslim world will be
      a utopia, will unequipped to face a new challenge. Kaiser argues scientific
      endeavour in the Muslim world will be utterly impossible, it will enforce conformity,
      singular mindset like a singularity, hive-mind like entity. When the Caliphate
      was formed during War of the Universe, many Muslims around the world rallied
      behind the movement, they blindly had faith to the Caliph. Kaiser said the
      following:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Muslims are the closest thing to a hive-mind entity
      society. Pahliv the Rebel (Caliph of the Caliphate) issuing orders and all
      Muslims including Muslims in the Sixtus Core are obeying his thoughts. Then
      they had crusade-like defensive stance against anyone attempts to attack their
      religion. If a piece of knowledge or edict against the holy book, they will
      use mental gymnastics or ridiculous circumvention to avoid that like the idiotic
      0% interest rate is banned for Muslims so they used retardedly convoluted alternative
      instruments to do it. The worst they used mob mentality, truth does not matter
      if the mob is satisfied. This is hence I must reduce the population of them
      by conversion or secularize or \u2018pacify\u2019 them.\u201D\r\n\r\nObviously,
      Islam is not the only ideology Kaiser criticizes, he sees pattern in other
      things like how both Sixtusian and Western progressive liberals according to
      the Kaiser: had severe fetishism with LGBT, gender and pronouns that they started
      to loses with reality. Then, Christianity was criticized by the Kaiser as similar
      to Islamic mob mentality particularly in the US conservatives and medieval
      era. He mocked Jesus as \u2018proto-socialist\u2019, \u2018Wine-converter man\u2019
      and \u2018Water Levitator\u2019, then the absurdity miracles mentioned in the
      holy book. Kaiser simply called it a work of fiction exaggerated by its authors:\r\n\r\n\u201CThis
      is clearly a fictional tale. I treat this as a bestselling fictional novel
      of the antiquity.\u201D\r\n\r\nHowever, all religions of humans received a
      \u2018shock\u2019 not the arrival of the \u2018alien\u2019 Sixtusian Empire
      or the revelation existence of other races like the Titan, Dionary, Cassantor
      and Elven but its shock comes from the existence of the Elder Races of the
      Titan and Elven who had existed for hundreds of thousands of years and the
      existence of the Warp Gate which had been hidden secretly by the Titan for
      the entire human existence. This lead conspiracy theories that the Titan or
      Elven race might have intervene during ancient times that inspires the signs
      of \u2018Gods\u2019 however both the Elven and Titan officially denied they
      have fiddled the humans in ancient times. The Elven in the other hand, had
      lived both on Safarian and Dionarian homeworld with direct intervention. Eltravivor
      Empire for instance, acted as the proxy state for the Elistar Empire to control
      the movements of Safarian. They locked Safarian race to forced them stuck in
      an industrial feudalist era to prevent them from going too far technologically
      and to enforce \u2018harmony\u2019, inciting the romanticism of the imperial,
      industrial era for thousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe Caliphate early rise was
      shoved off as another rebellion as many who opposes the rise of the Sixtusian
      Empire. But things took for the worse after the July Plot in 2033 when the
      brutality of Muslims were unleashed against the world through fatwa to restore
      the caliphate and to dakwah the whole world. The moment when the Muslims started
      massacring Hindus and non-Muslims is when the Kaiser was totally baffled of
      their hive-mind like society and their nature of not questioning the authorities.
      Kaiser saw the fundamental corrupt structure of the religion made it impossible
      to coexist with other religions and race, silently desire the destruction of
      non-Muslim religions that caused the Kaiser to vow on aggressively suppress
      the religion:\r\n\r\n\u201CHow do you let this religion exist is beyond me.
      This is a religion that likes to present itself as a peaceful religion, its
      followers pretentiously claiming it\u2019s the greatest religion that teaches
      everything from finance to the way of life. It is highly dangerous when a religion
      attempts to dictates everything, the enforcement of sharia laws demanded every
      Muslim to follow or punishment is inevitable. Those living under the religion
      were under suppression, crush of its potentiality & intellectuality, becoming
      the worse version of itself. No matter how much they proclaim \u2018we will
      exist coexist peacefully with non-Muslims\u2019, their main tenets of aggressive
      dakwah, forceful inviting people into their religion using its numerical superiority/mob
      mentality and secretly \u2018demonization\u2019 every non-Muslims as kafir
      are absolutely rooted on its core. A swift attack on its rotten structure will
      bring the entire shit down.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs in line with Kaiser\u2019s Uberwelt,
      Earth\u2019s West, secularist culture has greatly clashed with Islamic culture.
      He called that war will always be inevitable due to its contrasting values.
      Christianity and Judaism was similarly staunchly orthodox like Islam but through
      the process of secularization and European enlightenment, it eventually reforms
      itself to become much more relaxed and open to science and criticism. Many
      of Muslims have rejected bi\u2019dah and heavily adopt Sunnah as much as possible,
      this anti-reform attitude is one the big problems of integrating Muslims immigrants
      into European world. With such great differing view and values, Kaiser called
      Europeans\u2019 Islamophobia is justified and understandable especially the
      \u2018Arab boot-licker idiots\u2019 ingrained the religion with the Arab identity,
      unlike Christianity which is ethnically agnostic thanks the first country who
      adopts it: the Roman Empire collapsed. It was a religion that absolutely sapping
      Muslims around the world to benefits only the Arabs. Due to Arab and Islam
      becomes strictly interlinked, all Muslims will conform to the Arab world even
      though they are not Arabs, Kaiser mocked Muslims: \u201CAt this stage all of
      them should just convert to Arab, altogether.\u201D\r\n\r\nKaiser noted there
      is no religion that respects other religion of its values instead, it is the
      blissful ignorance of the multi-religious state to not interfere with each
      other and only to interact with others that is not related to religion in where
      the respect is only from their difference in identity not the religion\u2019s
      tenets, ideas or doctrines. The respect is only \u2018surface level\u2019 which
      is the clothes, the customs, the \u2018exoticism\u2019 and the appearance of
      it.\r\n\r\nKaiser\u2019s criticism of Judaism and Christianity are lesser due
      to the lack of problems with it. Nevertheless, he disliked the fictional nature
      of the books and its ridiculous claims. He called it no better than Islam itself.
      \r\n\r\nJudaism\u2019s chosen people is literally \u2018will to power\u2019
      to the collective masses. It parallels to Timekeeper\u2019s agent of destroyer
      and Kaiser\u2019s behavior: people who believes they are special and wants
      to achieve something doesn\u2019t always get the achievement but those who
      never believes in their specialness and never attempt will always never gets
      the achievement. In addition, Jews lives in Europe are isolated, floating similarly
      to Timekeepers as if they are disconnected from the masses, hence able to see
      the world from the anti-thesis perspective and contribute significantly to
      the world.\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Self-Centeredness Problem "
    content: "\rKaiser warned against self-centeredness, self-care or the idea of
      loving yourself taking too far. He remarked on the issue:\r\n\r\n\u201CSelf-centeredness
      is retarded concept led by fatfuckers, LGBT movements or other idiots that
      attempt to justify its laziness and immobility towards greatness. Hiding behind
      its identity and its inferiority is the epitome of a person who is incapable
      of change. Locking people\u2019s true potentiality. People who don\u2019t build
      sufficient feedback loops to correct itself; not being in anxiety and stays
      in the status quo of mediocrity will be drown in their own biases, world view
      confined to their own views and an echo chamber. This echo chamber that exists
      within a community is devil\u2019s circle that can worsened biases, leaving
      permanent flawed idea of pattern ingrained to their own brain for the rest
      of their life. Similar to addictions.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor the Kaiser, balancing
      between individualism and communitarian is important. In line with Social-Capitalism,
      Kaiser believes that self-centeredness must in the right balance so that individuality
      can be retained while criticism can be used to improve one\u2019s self and
      to be better in retrospective of one\u2019s self. The realm of the metaphysics
      and the materialist must be balanced.\r\n\r\nThe American ideology has a major
      flaw in that it posits individuality and freedom as its main tenet for its
      achievements and prosperity however this is greatly misleading. The real advantage
      of the United States is complex society. United States\u2019 highly varied
      types of individuals and stable economy allowed for innovation and systematic
      feedback loop that constantly iterates and fixes its mistakes. China, South
      Korea, Japan and Vietnam grows into great economic power thanks its unified
      homogenous population and lack of different ethnics. The communitarian nature
      of those countries eliminates trivial problems in the bottom matters and focuses
      on the greater things, hence you cannot innovate or do anything if basic things
      left untreated. US\u2019 \u2018fatfuckers\u2019 according to Kaiser and its
      red tapes has caused them to be sapped from actual real productive works and
      focuses on the unnecessaries. Money could be spent on real productive things
      was spent on food and healthcare.\r\n\r\nThe self-centeredness individuality
      of American ideology has caused American fall into the spell of the metaphysics
      realm rather than materialistic realm which the false consciousness was shaped
      by materialistic things itself. \r\n\r\nWhen a person became an employee, a
      corporate slave, it must not have the consciousness to revolt or else everything
      will collapse and revolts. The na\xEFve of a person must be retained, by giving
      materialistic things to distract it. In capitalistic world, the naivety of
      a person is preserved by creating a problem then sell of solution, example:
      \u201CFast foods are cheap and accessible so many people get sick which they
      will pay hefty sum of money for healthcare while investors & capitalists are
      profit each other\u201D. \r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Repressed Consciousness of the Masses '
    content: "In a society, everyone has their own repressed negative behaviours
      in order to keep the harmony society in tact however a pattern will emerge
      hence that common repressed behaviour is the \u2018repressed consciousness\u2019.
      \r\n\r\nFrom many studies, it is showed that many people desire a group sex
      or interchangeable sexual partners but the legacy system of the old society
      prevented people to conduct such behaviour or action. In Sixtus, polyamory
      is the most common type of relationship, people able to conduct casual sex
      with many people without significant consequences. The total liberation of
      repressed desires of the masses enabled Sixtus to do many things that other
      societies can\u2019t, gaining a major comparative advantages. \r\n\r\nSixtusian
      society had reorganized itself to bring a total \u2018destruction\u2019 of
      its conventional and conservative relationship structure. The old family structure
      of 1 man and 1 wife is a legacy system that had been \u2018purged\u2019. Many
      have argued the change was primarily caused by economic system and societal
      reforms.\r\n\r\nKaiser had numerous warnings to any countries that attempt
      to adopt highly advanced Sixtusian technology while staunchly defend its cultures
      and not adopting Sixtus\u2019 social-capitalism society structure:\r\n\r\n\u201CTo
      steal our technology is easy but to innovate from scratch while retaining your
      pathetic culture and way of thinking is impossible. The Sixtusian able to rise
      this fast only because it liberated the repressed consciousness of the masses.
      If you do not liberate it, then you will only cause false consciousness; a
      misalignment and disconnection with reality.\u201D\r\n\r\nBefore Kaiser\u2019s
      rise, the hikikomori (Japanese term for being confined; severe social withdrawal)
      was common amongst Sixtusian youth however Kaiser launched the Totalitarian
      Youth and \u201CSend-Down Youth\u201D programs which radically eliminates many
      socially isolated young people. Kaiser rejected that socially isolated people
      are incapable of social activities or physically/mentally inferior, Kaiser
      much more believed that these people were simply brought onto the wrong consciousness
      that is damaging to these people, he remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CA na\xEFve person
      must be clashed with reality and they must dragged out from their homes. Introducing
      an artificial boundary or wrong type of consciousness will lead a person to
      their doom. You tell them X and obey to it because the society told you to
      do it. You have been dictated by the dictatorship of the masses. Mass society
      has successfully reduced you into an NPC, a generic pathetic people.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt
      is unacceptable that we have turned like this. There must some kind of rejuvenation
      of the spirit. People are isolated becoming easy to divide and conquer. Becoming
      capitalist\u2019 prey. The youth was given the false, wrong consciousness,
      materialistic things to distract them from becoming the greatest version of
      one\u2019s self. They give you stupid entertainment and false political movement,
      becoming the worst of yourself.\u201D\r\n\r\nSocially isolated people are argued
      by Kaiser being led into the worst version of one\u2019s self. They lay down
      at home, becoming lazy, unproductive and unhealthy. When these type of people
      becoming a lot, there will be a repressed consciousness shared amongst hikikomori.
      These hikikomori can be weaponized if handled well according to the Kaiser:
      \r\n\r\n\u201CThere are a million of socially isolated people and \u2018degenerate\u2019
      people. An unused, idle people waiting to be mobilized. I simply cannot have
      idle people do nothing hence they must dragged out from their homes. Joining
      the Totalitarian Youth will rejuvenate them. Without doubt the retarded progressive
      movement and conformist behaviour has isolated many young people hence I will
      pit these two in the gladiator arena to fight each other. A net good. For the
      socially isolated people as they will be resuscitated into a fresh, functional
      citizen. For me, the political circus, \u2018filibustering\u2019 of the progressives
      is dead.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo longer they became the retards of society. Instead,
      they all became the greatest version of themselves. The beasts have been unleashed.\u201D\r\n\r\nLiberation
      and shatter the rules of conformity allowed for social liberation. The people
      no longer stuck in a gridlock where they are able to express themselves. While
      the gender movement self-proclaims itself as freedom of expression, Kaiser
      rejected these claim as a distortion and only creates unnecessary societal
      complexity which creates a lot rules which then made people becomes reluctant
      to engage social behaviour. By reducing and crushing complex identity to one
      (as in military), people are much communitarian, easy to understand each other.
      But Kaiser\u2019s support for complex society meant crushing identity must
      only be temporary as reducing complexity of a society will reduce innovation
      and hamper Uberwelt. The pursue of temporarily reducing identity is to enable
      social cohesion and understanding to prevent social frictions.\r\n\r\nAnother
      example repressed consciousness of the masses: during a major racial protest,
      white people in the United States bows and beg forgiveness to African American
      for the slavery and discrimination however a year after it happened, some questioned
      the sincerity of it and why they do it. Or in some places like the church or
      in Indonesia, a phenomenon where people become suddenly possessed by demons.
      According to the Kaiser, they are in the state of false consciousness and being
      \u2018possessed\u2019 by their own repressed consciousness, very similar to
      how people actually want to group sex or mass sex but cannot due to societal
      restrictions. They repress their desires and finds the perfect opportunity
      to unleash their \u2018repressed sexual desires\u2019. They are in a state
      of surrendering themselves to nature, roleplaying in state of \u2018being possessed\u2019
      or \u2018slave\u2019 because people are in their nature, likes to roleplay
      or put themselves in someone\u2019s shoes.\r\n\r\nDeep, hidden, repressed consciousness
      of the masses can be expressed to a video game, movies and a piece of entertainment
      that hasn\u2019t existed yet. What does this mean? A movie or video game can
      blow up and success if it resonates with masses and no other media had the
      likes of it. Many people might have a common repressed desire of some things.
      By creating a piece of media that fulfil these desires will cure many of the
      people\u2019s problems and ailments.\r\n\r\n"
