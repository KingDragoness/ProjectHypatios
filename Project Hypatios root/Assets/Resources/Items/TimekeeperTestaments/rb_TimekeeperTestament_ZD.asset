  - chapterName: 'Ionis and the WIRED '
    content: "Ionis is created primarily to supersede the entire biological race.
      The internal clock of a biological being is heavily tied to the circadian rhythm,
      24 hours; isn\u2019t really compatible with hostile space environment and the
      lengthy space exploration. As warp drive is only possible on the planetary
      surface not in spaceships. Planetary warp gates are the only way for interstellar
      travel and constructing one means it has to travel to that planet using the
      fastest spaceship at 1/10 speed of light.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the WIRED is basically
      a very large server, big data that contains the information of every single
      person\u2019 identity in the world. They were primarily maintained by Mobius
      Corps with the government heavily collaborates with Mobius. It records one\u2019s
      face, personality, voice, history, body and other info every year. \r\n\r\nOne
      could download construct of a person and emulate him/her in the smartphone
      or PC however due to a law within the empire, downloading or using someone\u2019s
      living identity is strictly forbidden, so many simply circumvent this by synthesize
      a new construct with little modification from the cloned identity. The utility
      of someone\u2019s construct can be used as a personal entertainment, to make
      AI voice or using 3d model of a person. The readily availability of 3d model
      of a person and affordable 3d printing are used by people to customize their
      own humanoid robots, usually for household purposes or at worse, malicious
      purposes. With humanoid robots becoming common and accessible, there were a
      large dedicated robot hobbyist across the empire. It is becoming similar in
      size as how there were large PC gamer enthusiasts before the formation of empire.
      \r\n\r\nCurrently, the protocol to deploy an Ionis is the soul of an Ionis
      must be cloned from a real-life identity. The identity of an Ionis must cloned
      in from the WIRED in order to \u2018de-noise\u2019 the behavior, increase its
      predictability and \u2018personality fallback\u2019 so it will not stray too
      much when it went through machine learning.\r\n"
