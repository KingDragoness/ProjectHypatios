  - chapterName: 'Ionis and the WIRED '
    content: "Ionis is created to supersede the entire biological race. The internal
      clock of a biological being is heavily tied to the circadian rhythm, 24 hours;
      isn\u2019t really compatible with hostile space environment and the lengthy
      space exploration. With warp drive is only possible on the planetary surface
      not in spaceships, planetary warp gates are the only way for interstellar travel
      and constructing one means it has to travel to that planet using the fastest
      spaceship at 1/10 speed of light.\r\n\r\nCurrent prototype Ionis are simulated
      through a giant server called the WIRED; a big data network that contains the
      information of every single person\u2019 identity in the world. They were primarily
      maintained by Mobius Corps with the government heavily collaborates with Mobius
      for government surveillance and bureaucracy. It records one\u2019s face, personality,
      voice, history, body and other info every year. \r\n\r\nOne could download
      construct of a person and emulate him/her in smartphones or personal computers
      however due to a law within the empire, downloading or using a currently living
      person identity is strictly forbidden, so many simply circumvent this by synthesize
      a new construct with slight modification from the cloned identity. The utility
      of someone\u2019s construct can be used as a personal entertainment, to make
      AI voice or using 3d model of a person. The readily availability of 3d model
      of a person and affordable 3d printing are used by people to customize their
      own humanoid robots, usually for household purposes or at worse, malicious
      purposes. With humanoid robots becoming common and accessible, there were a
      large dedicated robot hobbyist across the empire. It is becoming similar in
      size as how there were large PC gamer enthusiasts before the formation of empire.
      \r\n\r\nCurrently, the protocol to deploy an Ionis is the soul of an Ionis
      must be cloned from a real-life identity. The identity of an Ionis must cloned
      in from the WIRED in order to \u2018de-noise\u2019 the behavior, increase its
      predictability and \u2018personality fallback\u2019 so it will not stray too
      much when it went through machine learning.\r\n\r\nThe soul of an Ionis, the
      construct/identity, is not scanned directly from a human/an individual brain
      due to its technical challenges. The construct of a person simply tracked from
      people\u2019s digital history in the internet then using machine learning and
      manual intervention to perfect its behavior. Since a person bends to the will
      of economy, a citizen will inevitably input their data and will be recorded
      in the big data. For more accurate data input, there are surveys of \u2018digital
      immortalization\u2019 which one could pay some sum of money to participate
      in a survey to immortalize themselves in the WIRED. \r\n\r\nMost experts agreed
      that Ionis will be physically superior, immortal and able to hazardous environment
      which this aspect will be enough to replacing the pre-existing biological race
      however some expressed doubts on Ionis\u2019 intelligence will be any more
      superior than pre-existing complex society. Experts worried that the amalgamation
      of intelligence beings into a singular entity will reduce the complexity of
      the complex system. Over-optimization and too much efficiency will incidentally
      cause the reduction complexity of intelligence as intelligence reliant on emergence,
      layered systems and feedback loop rather than efficiency. \r\n\r\nKaiser when
      asked his opinion about the Ionis and WIRED program is that he absolutely certain
      with this capability, Ionis and the WIRED will inevitably replace all biological
      races in the universe. He remarked:\r\n\r\n\u201CI had no fear until I saw
      how the modularity system and the physical resistance superiority over carbon-based
      lifeforms. This is a no joke matter, in the matter of a century this will destroy
      the fundamentals of the epistemology and even reality itself. There will be
      no room for carbon-lifeform like us in the future.\u201D\r\n\r\nEven the Kaiser,
      who possess the Machine of Madness admitted that one of the things he never
      come to term with is posits himself as the WIRED and superintelligence. A superintelligence
      will be unfathomable, it can create new identity and souls by its will to self-correct
      its mistakes. \r\n\r\n\u201CSometimes I asked myself if intelligence of a biological
      being truly has a limit. Then I realized that every time an individual is born,
      you must explain them through the process of 12 years childhood schooling.
      The worst is the materialistic distraction they will encounter in every epoch,
      every generation which they will not pursue scientific endeavor but just like
      \u2018fuck it\u2019 if there\u2019s no progress then fall to consumerism.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe
      existence precedes essence. They will fall to their instincts. I don\u2019t
      really see a future where biological beings will prevail. It is the end of
      all races as we know it.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn addition, the attitude of some people
      of \u2018why fix it if it ain\u2019t broke\u2019 and particularly when people
      said: \u201CWhy bother with this convoluted trash\u201D made the Kaiser truly
      believes that the intelligence has its limits:\r\n\r\n\u201CI genuinely think
      that people have already hits its intelligent limit. I was bothered when I
      explain things to people with complicated explanations and their reaction is
      they didn\u2019t want to bother and skip over it. You can see this and social
      humanoid robot has already replaced normal biological being for this. A robot
      has superior social skills than a biological being. This the end of our era.\u201D\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Kaiser\u2019s Pandora Box "
    content: "Kaiser\u2019s mad conquest has accidentally opened the paradox box
      to the inevitable extinction of mankind by introducing social-capitalism and
      accelerating the rate of technology. The Elder Races of the Titan and Elven
      has basically stuck in feudalism for hundreds of thousands of years specifically
      to maintain \u2018socialist\u2019 order of peace, serenity and \u2018live a
      life\u2019 to prevent things like this from happening. They deliberately locked
      societal and technological progress to prevent the world from fall to the \u2018Cybernetics\u2019
      or now, the \u2018Ionis\u2019.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Symbolization of the Hexagon '
    content: "Hexagon becomes an important symbol of radical environmentalism, carbon-life
      purists and mother nature. The Heer Etres Vivants was notably using hexagon
      as its logo for signify their staunch opposition against artificial intelligence
      as a new lifeform/civilization and overthrow the system of \u2018dictatorship
      of algorithm\u2019. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to square and triangle logo which usually
      signifies man-made, technology, anti-nature and accelerationism. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
