  - chapterName: "Casualties of Kaiser\u2019s Conquest "
    content: "The casualties of Kaiser\u2019s mad conquest is that most of deaths
      was caused by economic disruption and supply chain destruction; the worst of
      it was Sixtusian\u2019 monopolistic control of the vaccines that prevents contagion;
      they had total control of pathogen elimination. In War of the Universe, total
      casualties reached over 3 billion, many that died was caused by biological
      warfare where the Sixtusian simply formed a highly secretive yet small unit
      biological specialist force of ~300 members that creates viruses that kills
      non-Safarian race; it was delivered secretly. \r\n\r\nTo assert authority,
      the Sixtusian did the capitalist card trick by \u2018Create the problem and
      sell the solution\u2019, the Sixtusian both spread and cure the diseases. Since
      Safarian are not affected and the government is under Kaiser\u2019s authoritarian
      rule, the diseases simply blamed on unconducive political conditions that disturb
      the supply chain and made it difficult to deliver the vaccines and medicines.
      The lesser races (Cassantors, Humans) are at the mercy of Sixtusian Empire,
      Dionarian are able to manufacture its own vaccines but thanks to its semi-feudalist
      society, its industrial capability was lacking and only produce for the upper
      classes. Only the Elven and Titan race were able to resist all biological threats
      completely.\r\n\r\nBy actively screwing up and fiddling politics of other nations,
      Kaiser knows this will destabilize those countries and cause immigrants to
      enter Sixtus. Kaiser remarks:\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, I know by fucking around these
      countries I will cause them to enter Sixtus. But unlike hypocritical Europeans
      and Americans who dislikes immigrants, I from day one had likened the idea
      of immigrants or destabilize other country so that the Sixtusian Empire will
      gain free labors. Sixtusian\u2019s social-capitalism is an ideology that believes
      on ushering true socialism, a true, very transparent and tangible goals. Those
      pesky idiot Earth westoid\u2019s ideology and philosophy of \u2018freedom\u2019
      and \u2018democracy\u2019 were pathetic ideologies that has no tangible meaning.
      Instead the only true goal is to achieve socialism, extract resources from
      space and build technology to delegate manual labour to machinery and liberate
      the workforce!\u201D\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of being a Timekeeper, Kaiser
      is an accelerationist. Rapid iteration to rapidly advance technology while
      somewhat sacrificing social values and structure of society. Uberwelt, creating
      unified super culture is aimed to destroy pre-existing cultures that were inferior
      and potentially friction with cultures. \r\n\r\nKaiser absolutely knows and
      felt the horror and terror of his actions however he justified it on his remarks:\r\n\r\n\u201CTo
      conquer the universe, I must destroy the state and override it with a new culture.
      With it, basically I had to two options: Either kill people or convert them.
      Killing them is much faster while converting them takes time. I try at my absolute
      best to not kill people unfortunately some people\u2019s mind is hard to change.
      Once you indoctrinate a person, the pattern in their brain was solidified.
      The belief and the body merges.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COnce a person merges themselves
      with an ideology, it will be sunk cost fallacy. Hence, the only way to get
      rid it is to disintegrate their body, reduce them to atom, return them to nature
      and let that atoms be converted to a new being, lifeform.\u201D \r\n\r\nKaiser
      can be easily classified of being a psychopath and a tyrant however his lack
      of moral and ethics are a clear consequence from being a Timekeeper. Kaiser
      psychopathy was not from its nature but rather thanks to Timekeeper\u2019s
      eternal loop madness and his control of the Machine of Madness. Kaiser\u2019s
      emancipation can be classified as \u2018too much emancipation\u2019 which turns
      him into an \u2018the ultimate ubermensch\u2019 and \u2018the most final and
      complete of Ubermensch\u2019. Citadel remarks:\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot help to
      think that the Kaiser thought he is God of the world by possessing the Machine
      of Madness and controlling all of Timekeepers. By the end War of the Universe,
      he thought that he is a greater being than a God. He believes that he is the
      most complete version of the superior man.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe biggest source
      of deaths is the transmission of diseases. Prior Sixtusian Empire arrived on
      Earth in 2016, they have conducted a very careful kidnapping to experiment
      human beings to research on building a vaccine and medicines to prevent Safarian
      diseases and pathogens potentially killing many of the human populace. Upon
      their arrival, the Sixtusian Empire immediately distributing billions of medicines
      and vaccines however despite Kaiser\u2019s ultimate priority and best effort
      through his Timekeeper abilities, some Earth populace were resistant against
      the \u2018alien invaders\u2019 who suddenly began distributing vaccines without
      clear communication then encountered logistics problems when mass protests
      erupted. Eventually, a pandemic quickly sprung up and wiping out 250 million
      humans until it stopped in 2021 when everyone finally started to become desperate
      and take Sixtusian medicines.\r\n\r\nThe pandemic instantly subjugated the
      human race; however, it caused significant political instability. The Sixtusian-Alphanian
      War distracted the Sixtusian from foreign matters and the Earth becomes embroiled
      in political and social issues. After the war, the Sixtus becomes very aggressively
      intervenes Earth\u2019s geopolitics starting from Sixtusian Invasion of North
      Korea, Invasion of DR Congo and launching Operation Enpurification which is
      a genocide that murdered over 300k people (mostly Mexicans) in the span of
      a decade to combat drugs, \u2018depopulate\u2019 degenerates and finish off
      drug users. Having the Sixtusian Empire involve directly killing the masses
      would be horrible to the empire\u2019s image, instead, the Kaiser initiated
      divide and conquer strategy to rapidly finish off people that Kaiser classified
      as \u2018savage animals\u2019 and politically active people. \r\n\r\nOn one
      instance, Kaiser\u2019s hatred of the Muslims led the initiation of propaganda
      divide the Muslim and Hindus, transferring significant technologies to America,
      Europe, East Asia and India but forbid any Muslim countries or poor African
      countries to gain any under the pretext \u2018still barbarian state\u2019.
      This then raised significant tensions and despite Sixtus import a lot of oils
      and absorb immigrants, Kaiser antagonism towards the religion and hinted at
      cultural genocide build up angers amongst them. The rise of Caliphate in 2027
      that overthrow Gulf States then intensify the tensions further, which Sixtus
      enforced trade embargo and total trade blockade. During War of the Universe,
      the Sixtusian Empire was heavily distracted by the United Dionary Empire which
      the Caliphate uses its opportunity to invade and topple many countries on Earth.
      The Caliphate forged allies with every Muslim country however Caliphate\u2019s
      invasion of Israel and conquest of Turkey\u2019s Kurdistan caused significant
      backlash which then no-one was supporting the Caliphate. With the war ongoing
      with UDE, the combined alliance of Sixtusian Empire and United Nations of around
      40+ countries declared war against the Caliphate in July 2033 when the Caliphate
      launched a July Plot which failed to kill the Kaiser, only was badly wounded
      in the assassination attempt. With no room for retreat, the Caliphate began
      invading in all directions with its peak reaching:\r\n\u2022\tIn Europe, they
      reached maximum extent 70km from Serbian southern borders and sieging Bucharest
      for several months before being pushed back. Greece & Albania occupied with
      Montenegro barely occupied.\r\n\u2022\tThe entire MENA region was under the
      Caliphate rule with exception of Morocco. \r\n\u2022\tIn South Asia, Afghanistan,
      Bangladesh and Pakistan was totally occupied while Nepal and Bhutan barely
      occupied. In India, all of North India were occupied while the South are still
      under the control of Indian government.\r\n\u2022\tIn South-East Asia, its
      maximum extent is at the borders of Thailand and 70km into China\u2019s Yunnan
      borders.\r\n\u2022\tIn Central Asia, all except Kazakhstan was under the Caliphate
      rule. The Caliphate penetrate deep into Xinjiang, from the north 360 km into
      the borders, just 60km from Urumqi, Xinjiang\u2019s provincial capital and
      conquering Hotan prefecture and barely the Bayingolin prefecture. Tibet was
      barely occupied due to its geography and lack of strategic importance especially
      lack of Muslims.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Brainwash of Sixtusian Soldiers '
    content: "Sixtus has a highly secular, moral and intelligent population this
      made it almost impossible to turn Sixtusian into a killing machine. But Kaiser
      ingenious technic to justify Sixtusian soldier to kill civilians is not by
      fear or terror but by twisting their fundamentals belief of the world.\r\n\r\nSocial-Capitalism
      basically teaches that everyone including foreign races such as humans, Titans,
      Dionarians, etc are obliged to be equally treated like the Safarians, the main
      race of Sixtusian Empire. With this, every race should treat like brothers
      and sisters because they are united in one common element: carbon lifeform.
      With this in mind, it is also taught that everyone is made up of atoms and
      then if they die, they decompose, disintegrate into disorganized atoms and
      will \u2018return\u2019 to nature.\r\n\r\nThe Empire teaches that when killing
      a person, they are not making that person de-exist or disappear, instead they
      are simply disintegrating and becomes unorganized atoms. Justification is that
      the atoms of Sixtusian are arranged in the \u2018right\u2019 order while their
      enemies are arranged in the \u2018wrong\u2019 order so in order to correct
      it, they must disintegrate them and return them back to nature. This is used
      from Sixtusian\u2019 progressivism standpoint where abortion is very common
      if the pregnant child is discovered to be disabled; by killing it, you are
      able to prevent the future suffering of the child or put it in other \u2018poetic\u2019
      words: the atoms of the future child will be in the wrong order so in order
      to correct, we must kill it, disintegrate it to return it to nature then pregnant
      another child and hopes the next child will be in the right order. \r\n\r\nSixtusian
      Army soldier\u2019s handbook of when killing a person:\r\n\r\n\u201CThe person
      you are killing is a defect being, their atoms have been composed together
      in the wrong order that made their brain\u2019s pattern not \u2018straight\u2019.
      By killing them, you are returning them to nature. Then it will reborn as a
      new being, potentially reborn as a Sixtusian with less \u2018error\u2019 as
      they will be educated in Sixtusian way. By then, by killing them, you are lessening
      the suffering of these people. It is like when you are terminally sick then
      you must do euthanasia or baby is disabled so you must abort it. Killing these
      degenerate and defect people is the same as the aborting a defect baby or killing
      yourself from suffering.\u201D\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Deleted Timelines '
    content: "With the Machine of Madness under Kaiser\u2019s possession, it is inevitable
      that the Kaiser will use the Machine to conduct experiment or do some stupid
      things with it. Most of his experiments are social experiment intended as a
      joke or to see the reaction of \u2018naive\u2019 people he called. This included
      the notorious numerous summoning incidents of several ambassadors into the
      Kaiser\u2019s Palace only to be called by racial slurs as an \u2018experiment\u2019.
      Or the other is insulting other religion like calling one of Dionary\u2019s
      religion as a \u2018Gay sex cult\u2019 or the notorious remark of \u2018black
      ninja shinobi\u2019 of burqa clothes.\r\n\r\nHis mad experiments are mostly
      quickly reversed using the Machine of Madness and only Timekeepers are the
      witness of these events. This is called the \u2018Deleted Timelines\u2019,
      timelines that were scrapped by the Kaiser, becoming non-canon events. \r\n\r\nThis
      level of exploitation of Machine of Madness meant technically many things has
      already happened. The possibilities are possibly already happened, it just
      that, it was only witnessed by Timekeeper, making it overwhelmingly undocumented.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Send-Down Youth '
    content: "With Sixtus move towards reindustrialization, the Sixtusian government
      initiated mandatory social programs for the youths to work in factories, mining
      or resource extraction. These social programs can replace half-time of mandatory
      military service. The Send-Down Youth program was needed due to Sixtusian corporations
      failed to attract young people to work, constantly vacant jobs even with attractive
      income and perks. Kaiser argued that the service sector and entertainment industry
      has grown like \u2018cancer\u2019 and caused people to become lazy, by dragging
      people from their \u2018houses\u2019 and establish a totalitarian rule, Kaiser
      argued he could mobilize Sixtusian citizens quicker.\r\n\r\nOne of the \u2018send-down
      youth\u2019 objective is the temporary reduction of complex identity to singular
      identical identities. The justification is that in modern society, everyone
      focuses on different things and becomes alienated as everyone\u2019s understanding
      of the world converges. By initiating social programs, Kaiser hopes to reduce
      alienation and creates a harmonious cohesive society that will not clash each
      other. \r\n\r\nThe spirit of pre-Kaiser Sixtusian according to Kaiser: lazy,
      nihilism, lack of direction. Kaiser wanted to spark some kind of national rejuvenation
      in which the young\u2019s inner self will be unleashed and maximize their potentiality.
      According to Kaiser, he sees the madness of the current era where people consume
      more than they are able to swallow it: becoming fat, unhealthy from overconsumption
      or people unable to do great things because the stigma or the \u2018holding
      back\u2019 due to fear or their everyday pattern had solidified and unable
      to change their behavior. Kaiser\u2019s theory is that people must be dragged
      out from their homes, cross outside the line and be the greatest version of
      one\u2019s self. Those who lives blissfully and in ignorance will wake up in
      a greater nightmare, unable to face up the challenge they had presented upon
      to:\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen the mass society chanted parents must be soft, \u2018don\u2019t
      hit their child\u2019 and \u2018parent abuse\u2019, they are making the child
      into passive, conformist, slaves to the society. When the child is living in
      the bliss, oblivious, they will wake up in a greater nightmare. Reality hits.
      A mental state is like workout, one must hit themselves in the head to become
      more mentally hardened because in our mistakes, we became more self-consciousness,
      able to correct our mistakes.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe world has been given false
      consciousness that we must treat our child like a toddler. Our children must
      be slapped with reality and throw them to the streets to become the greatest
      version of one\u2019s self.\u201D\r\n"
