  - chapterName: 'Overthrowing the Impossible '
    content: "Since the start of War of the Universe, the opposition party of Sixtusian
      Democratic Party (SDP) has successfully inflict significant reputation damage
      of the Kaiser. War of the Universe, conscription policy, totalitarian state
      has severely damaged Kaiser\u2019s image; he has been effectively painted as
      \u2018mad conqueror of the galaxy\u2019. His popular support is waning, demanding
      the Kaiser to resign as he has not only achieved his goals but far outachieve
      it.\r\n\r\nSixtusian arrival on Earth was already quite unpopular however,
      the War of the Universe centralized the hatred from Sixtus to the Kaiser. Kaiser
      became very unpopular amongst the humans due to the devastation that the Kaiser
      brought to Earth and his politics of divide and conquer. His anti-Islamic views
      and hinted at Islamic cultural genocide directly responsible for the rise of
      the Caliphate and exacerbate Islamic extremism across the globe. In the meanwhile,
      Kaiser supported the Hindus and deliberately provoke the Muslims by not transferring
      technology to that country. This manipulation led the genocide of the Indians
      during Caliphate\u2019s invasion of India then when the Caliphate collapsing,
      the Hindus retaliated and do the same thing. The Sixtusian Empire did little
      to stop the genocide until after the war, in thanks the Kaiser intervened to
      do anything because the Kaiser need to fabricate justification of continuing
      colonization to \u2018discipline these barbarian races\u2019 and the worst
      of the extremists killed each other off. In other part of the world, the Sixtusian
      Outerboundary and military conducted numerous operations to serve Sixtusian\u2019
      national interest namely: the Sixtusian invasions which invaded North Korea,
      Afghanistan and several poor African countries to overthrow the government
      and replaced with a pro-Sixtusian ruler to allow exploitation of labor and
      natural resources. Then in Mexico, launched a massive military intervention
      to crackdown drugs and forced Sixtusian entities to open their factories there.
      Sixtusian imperialist policies made it unpopular. \r\n\r\nThe primary opposition
      of the Totalitarian Party, SDP has promised decolonization of many Sixtusian
      occupied territories and overthrowing the Kaiser out. This led the SDP gained
      massive support from non-Safarian race.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'The July Plot '
    content: "In the plane of Timekeepers, the July Plot plan was put under total
      secrecy from the Kaiser, its goal is to kill the Kaiser, relinquish control
      of the Sixtusian Empire to the Coalition of Timekeepers and seize the Machine
      of Madness. The July Plot nearly succeed in that Kaiser was assassinated and
      Citadel went to power until they realized the seized Machine of Madness was
      turned out to be fake and only Kaiser knew its true location. Looping back,
      the Kaiser then learnt about the plot and went into purging all of Timekeepers.
      With Kaiser went on a purge of Timekeepers and no possession of Machine of
      Madness, the Coalition relaunch the July Plot which put the Kaiser on coma
      for several months and Kingdom Citadel, as the head of the Coalition and Kaiser\u2019s
      right-hand man, to gain control of the Sixtusian Empire to temporarily held
      on power. In regards of perpetrator of the assassination, Kingdom Citadel manipulated
      Pahliv to send his assassin to kill Kaiser.\r\n\r\nWhen the assassination failed
      (deliberately) and Kaiser went to coma, Citadel seizes control of the empire
      and quickly put the blame to Pahliv Aul Said and the Caliphate, selling Pahliv
      out. Betrayed by the Coalitions, Pahliv quickly fall into a paranoia and total
      distrust to any non-Muslim, calling it the greatest fitnah and betrayal in
      the human race, he then issued a fatwa to all Muslims to attack pro-Sixtusian
      states and called Kingdom Citadel had been possessed by the demons and is not
      a human. In the brief Kaiser\u2019s vacant power, Citadel quickly arranged
      secret traps and sabotages so that when Kaiser wakes up from coma, all of Sixtusian
      Empire\u2019s sin would be attributed to Kaiser\u2019s fault. Kaiser ended
      up woke up much later than expected in January 2034 giving massive leverage
      to Citadel and basically setting up Kaiser\u2019s downfall in the future.\r\n\r\nWith
      Kaiser on coma and the Caliphate on blame for the plot, this gives Citadel
      the leverage to enact emergency decrees to gives the Coalition of Timekeepers
      an emergency temporary power. Citadel sabotages up a lot, he opened multiple
      new fronts in which later when Kaiser took over, he did extreme measures to
      rapidly win the war (like greenlighting massacres, planetary bombardments and
      ruthless aggressive offensive). It is obvious that Citadel\u2019s aggressive
      remarks and opening new fronts causes more hate to Citadel but Citadel\u2019s
      gamble paid off as once the Kaiser wakes up, he did not time vortex to correct
      Citadel\u2019s mistakes, instead he solves it by the extreme measures of continuing
      the war and violence. This mark the start political demise for the Kaiser.\r\n"
  - chapterName: 'Consequences of Citadel Takeover '
    content: "Tracing back through time, Kaiser appointment of Kingdom Citadel as
      his right hand-man but also being a human and a Timekeeper is a decision that
      no sense at first however according to the Kaiser, he saw social-capitalist
      interstellar of the Sixtusian Empire cannot prevail if the rule was mastered
      by the Safarian race only. Kaiser intended Citadel as his successor from the
      very beginning of the rise of the Sixtusian Empire especially with Citadel\u2019s
      Timekeeper powers. When Citadel kidnapped to be Kaiser\u2019s successor in
      2016, he was only 16 years old. The young Citadel can be brainwashed and trained
      by the Kaiser easily. In addition, since humans knows nothing about the Safarian
      race, the Kaiser sees it as the perfect of an unbiased being, a blank slate/canvas
      to be drawn by the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nAfter the Kaiser was ousted from power in
      2044, Kingdom Citadel and the SDP rise to become the president and majority
      party respectively. This dissolves the Kaiser title as the head of state, returning
      it back to \u2018democratic\u2019 presidential system.\r\n\r\nThe severely
      overly extended Sixtusian Empire had always been a major thorn and extremely
      unsustainable to maintain, hence Citadel regime decolonized many of Sixtusian
      occupied territories and attempt to return to the status quo for the released
      countries however roughly half of the territories and states conquered from
      Kaiser\u2019s conquest (excluding barren planet colonization) still under control
      till this day due to some land and territory being too strategically important
      to be de-colonized.\r\n\r\n"
  - chapterName: "Rules within Kaiser\u2019s Timekeepers and Deleted Timelines "
    content: "An overly centralized power will greatly limit Kaiser\u2019s ability
      to rule an expansive empire especially an overly extended empire. To help realizing
      his empire, he delegated the tasks to Timekeepers. Kaiser\u2019s remarks on
      establishing an authoritarian yet meritocratic system within his government
      with Timekeepers filling important positions to realize the Sixtusian Empire:\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
      do know it is impossible one to control everything hence I give mandate to
      Timekeepers to certain position and mold their identity into the position I
      assign them to. What they are and what they do will inevitably manifest their
      behavior, their appearances, their livelihood, their hobby and even taste of
      music. I mean, if you know\u2026 one of my Timekeeper is an idol, she was assigned
      to become a virtual celebrity whose job is to stream, sings and acts like an
      idol, becoming a representative of the young people, to become the manipulator
      of masses, an infinitely better communicator to young people than I would ever
      be. Once I saw the potential, reformed her pathetic fate, transform her and
      gave a purpose in the world than she would even ever fucking imagine. Remember
      these Timekeepers are free-floating entity, their identity can be changed if
      they hated the identity that was assigned but if they like it then it will
      be a deal.\u201D\r\n\r\nKaiser had personally mentored dozens of young Timekeepers
      to become Kaiser\u2019s personal helper and joined on Kaiser side. The naiveity
      of young Timekeepers are exploited heavily by the Kaiser and were provided
      with luxury apartments, cars, significant money and materials for them. Some
      argued these Timekeepers essentially put into some kind of \u2018time loop
      slavery\u2019 where they cannot escape from their fate until they were killed
      off, \u2018nirvana-ed\u2019 or removed from existence completely. These Timekeepers
      are practically banned from leaving as they were possessing \u2018forbidden
      knowledge\u2019 which make them permanently bind them to Kaiser\u2019s grip.\r\n\r\nKaiser
      knows the problem of political consciousness of Timekeepers is one of the biggest
      threats to the Kaiser. To remedy it, Kaiser enforces them by supplementing
      false consciousness: give them materialistic things and direct-sense gratification
      like social or appreciation. By default, Kaiser\u2019s Timekeepers will be
      self-estranged, prevent them from idle at all cost, prevented from diving into
      higher level consciousness and deliberately stripped its ability to determine
      its destiny; one\u2019s life was dictated by the Kaiser to prevent them ever
      rebelling against the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nKaiser operate his Timekeepers by opaquing
      his actions as possible by an example: ordering non-sensical orders like sending
      soldiers to some wasteland to cut some cactus. This all is to prevent the Coalition
      of Timekeeper from overthrowing the Kaiser which are threat since they had
      openly denounced the Kaiser. However, the head of the Coalition, Kingdom Citadel,
      is also Kaiser\u2019s right-hand man. This is because Citadel had same goals
      to rise the Empire and had absolute faith with Kaiser\u2019s ability but Citadel
      heavily dislikes the Kaiser\u2019s totalitarian dictatorship which centralized
      power to the Kaiser, instead Citadel was in favor of some kind of Timekeeper\u2019s
      aristocracy where the privileged Timekeeper rule the empire. \r\n\r\nIn many
      cases, Citadel had to concede since Kaiser\u2019s action is pragmatic to rise
      the empire but damaging to the Coalition; an example: Citadel deliberately
      do the \u2018lettement\u2019 (to let it happen) of some horrific things happens
      (like genocide) in order to convince Timekeepers to join the Coalition to further
      justify the overthrow of Kaiser from power. Compared to Kaiser\u2019s Timekeeper
      which peaked only around 30 Timekeepers, Citadel was able to amassed over 300
      Timekeepers into the Coalition. Citadel remarked about the Kaiser:\r\n\r\n\u201CThere
      is only two valid opinion of a Timekeeper towards the Kaiser: \u2018I don\u2019t
      care and I don\u2019t want get involved\u2019 or \u2018I hate the Kaiser\u2019.
      There is no in-between. With this, one thing is absolute: Not a single Timekeeper
      likes the Kaiser.\u201D\r\n"
