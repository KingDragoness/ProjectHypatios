  - chapterName: 'Overthrowing the Impossible '
    content: "Since the start of War of the Universe, the opposition party of Sixtusian
      Democratic Party (SDP) has successfully inflict significant reputation damage
      of the Kaiser. War of the Universe, conscription policy, totalitarian state
      has severely damaged Kaiser\u2019s image; he has been effectively painted as
      \u2018mad conqueror of the galaxy\u2019. His popular support is waning, demanding
      the Kaiser to resign as he has not only achieved his goals but far outachieve
      it.\r\n\r\nThe Coalition of Timekeepers anticipated this chaos by strengthen
      the SDP. Kingdom Citadel, the leader of SDP and Coalition of Timekeeper hasn\u2019t
      disobeyed Kaiser\u2019s orders yet, however he started a secretive movement
      to anticipate the \u2018inevitable\u2019 fall of the Kaiser. SDP began rebelling
      and disobeying against the Totalitarian Party\u2019s orders after War of the
      Universe, increasingly irritating the dominant party. The situation worsened
      in the 2040 Sindom Massacre which killed 14 SDP politicians. Just a month after
      the massacre, the government of Totalitarian party controlled Sindom state
      was overthrown by joint faction of SDP and other anti-Kaiser movements as a
      retaliation. The coup d\u2019etat caused massive political instability, throwing
      Sixtusian government system into dysfunctional; later Enguevivo did the same
      thing in the following year on 2041, sparking even more instability. However,
      Kaiser\u2019s grip of power was still relatively powerful on the federal level.\r\n\r\nThe
      enforcement of replacing UDE\u2019s feudalist society with Sixtusian\u2019
      social-capitalist system was met with great disaster. The aggressive industrialization
      and mass relocation policies killed significant of Dionarians, most died of
      starvation and diseases. The cumulative death toll rose from 6 million in 2038
      to 350 million by 2043. The news received significant spotlight starting in
      2042, intensifying the already strained support of the Kaiser. Many compared
      the Kaiser similar to his father who committed the Eltravivorian genocide although
      Kaiser technically did not commit any serious universal rights violation. \r\n\r\nIn
      the meanwhile, rebellion sprung up across Earth and Cassantor following War
      of the Universe. The former caliphate replaced by Sixtusian military administration
      (the MENA, South Asia and Central Asia) had become the poorest region on Earth,
      turning itself a hotbed for rebellion. Despite the population of Sixtus-occupied
      former Caliphate are around +1.4 billion people, the occupation was tight and
      repressive; stationed around 4.3 million Sixtusian-allied troops in the region
      which means 1 soldier per 325 civilians, among the highest of ratio occupying
      troops. \r\n\r\nThe internals of Totalitarian Party and Sixtusian Force realized
      the increasingly bad image of the Kaiser and began secretly discussing on overthrowing
      the Kaiser out and planning to replace a new First Secretary of the Totalitarian
      Party. The Kaiser founds out and launched a mass purge on March 2044 which
      hundreds of the party internals and the high command military officers were
      forcibly sent to penal colony in the fringe planets. The purge also targeted
      Hussando, the Commander of the Sixtusian Force but he was noticed quickly and
      fled to SDP-controlled Sindom state. The purge was unexpectedly becoming one
      of Kaiser\u2019s greatest blunder, sparking unrest on federal level. \r\n\r\nWithin
      a week after the purge, the Sixtusian Force Defectors was led by Hussando,
      sided with the SDP. The Sixtusian federal government collapses after the incident
      and the entire country was declared lockdown (except in Sindom and Enguevivo).
      Seizing opportunity, many rebel movements in colonized territories of Outerboundary
      started to launch mass rebellion en masse, coordinating together with the opposition.
      The Outerboundary government was rapidly overwhelmed and by April 2044, the
      Ministry of Outerboundary was de facto cease to function. In the meanwhile,
      an overwhelming of upset Totalitarian Party unanimously expelled all Kaiser\u2019s
      remaining supporters and declared Kaiser\u2019s First Secretary position as
      void and nominate a new First Secretary, leaving the Kaiser partyless. With
      Totalitarian Party itself antagonized the Kaiser, the Bunderlife state falls
      to the opposition. By now, only Kaiser\u2019s family, Kingsgard and federal
      government still on Kaiser\u2019s grip, fall was inevitable.\r\n\r\nOn 27 April
      2044, Army Defector, Coalition of the Timekeepers, many Sixtusian megacorporations,
      opposition parties and SDP launched its first coup d\u2019etat move against
      the Kaiser with a force of over 1 million seized the Kingdom of Kingsgard.
      In just one day, the entire Kingdom of Kingsgard collapsed and the Prince of
      Kingsgard surrendered full control to the opposition. \r\n"
  - chapterName: "Rules within Kaiser\u2019s Timekeepers and Deleted Timelines "
    content: "An overly centralized power will greatly limit Kaiser\u2019s ability
      to rule an expansive empire especially an overly extended empire. To help realizing
      his empire, he delegated the tasks to Timekeepers. Kaiser\u2019s remarks on
      establishing an authoritarian yet meritocratic system within his government
      with Timekeepers filling important positions to realize the Sixtusian Empire:\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
      do know it is impossible one to control everything hence I give mandate to
      Timekeepers to certain position and mold their identity into the position I
      assign them to. What they are and what they do will inevitably manifest their
      behavior, their appearances, their livelihood, their hobby and even taste of
      music. I mean, if you know\u2026 one of my Timekeeper is an idol, she was assigned
      to become a virtual celebrity whose job is to stream, sings and acts like an
      idol, becoming a representative of the young people, to become the manipulator
      of masses, an infinitely better communicator to young people than I would ever
      be. Once I saw the potential, reformed her pathetic fate, transform her and
      gave a purpose in the world than she would even ever fucking imagine. Remember
      these Timekeepers are free-floating entity, their identity can be changed if
      they hated the identity that was assigned but if they like it then it will
      be a deal.\u201D\r\n\r\nKaiser had personally mentored dozens of young Timekeepers
      to become Kaiser\u2019s personal helper and joined on Kaiser side. The naiveity
      of young Timekeepers are exploited heavily by the Kaiser and were provided
      with luxury apartments, cars, significant money and materials for them. Some
      argued these Timekeepers essentially put into some kind of \u2018time loop
      slavery\u2019 where they cannot escape from their fate until they were killed
      off, \u2018nirvana-ed\u2019 or removed from existence completely. These Timekeepers
      are practically banned from leaving as they were possessing \u2018forbidden
      knowledge\u2019 which make them permanently bind them to Kaiser\u2019s grip.\r\n\r\nKaiser
      knows the problem of political consciousness of Timekeepers is one of the biggest
      threats to the Kaiser. To remedy it, Kaiser enforces them by supplementing
      false consciousness: give them materialistic things and direct-sense gratification
      like social or appreciation. By default, Kaiser\u2019s Timekeepers will be
      self-estranged, prevent them from idle at all cost, prevented from diving into
      higher level consciousness and deliberately stripped its ability to determine
      its destiny; one\u2019s life was dictated by the Kaiser to prevent them ever
      rebelling against the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nKaiser operate his Timekeepers by opaquing
      his actions as possible by an example: ordering non-sensical orders like sending
      soldiers to some wasteland to cut some cactus. This all is to prevent the Coalition
      of Timekeeper from overthrowing the Kaiser which are threat since they had
      openly denounced the Kaiser. However, the head of the Coalition, Kingdom Citadel,
      is also Kaiser\u2019s right-hand man. This is because Citadel had same goals
      to rise the Empire and had absolute faith with Kaiser\u2019s ability but Citadel
      heavily dislikes the Kaiser\u2019s totalitarian dictatorship which centralized
      power to the Kaiser, instead Citadel was in favor of some kind of Timekeeper\u2019s
      aristocracy where the privileged Timekeeper rule the empire. \r\n\r\nIn many
      cases, Citadel had to concede since Kaiser\u2019s action is pragmatic to rise
      the empire but damaging to the Coalition; an example: Citadel deliberately
      do the \u2018lettement\u2019 (to let it happen) of some horrific things happens
      (like genocide) in order to convince Timekeepers to join the Coalition to further
      justify the overthrow of Kaiser from power. Compared to Kaiser\u2019s Timekeeper
      which peaked only around 30 Timekeepers, Citadel was able to amassed over 300
      Timekeepers into the Coalition. Citadel remarked about the Kaiser:\r\n\r\n\u201CThere
      is only two valid opinion of a Timekeeper towards the Kaiser: \u2018I don\u2019t
      care and I don\u2019t want get involved\u2019 or \u2018I hate the Kaiser\u2019.
      There is no in-between. With this, one thing is absolute: Not a single Timekeeper
      likes the Kaiser.\u201D\r\n"
