  _displayName: Spaceship Derelict Report
  _description: We are observing an anomaly of the newly found shining asteroid which
    turns out to be an ancient spaceship derelict found in the planet's depth. We
    speculated it is a Dionarian spaceship crashed around 1600-1700 years ago, evidenced
    by the discovery of Dionarian skeletons found inside.
