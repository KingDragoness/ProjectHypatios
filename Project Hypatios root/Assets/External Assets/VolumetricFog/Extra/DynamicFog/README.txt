How to use this asset
---------------------
Dynamic Fog & Mist includes 3 operation modes:

1) Traditional camera-based script: just add "DynamicFog" or "DynamicFog Exclusive" script to your camera. It will show up in the Game view. Customize it using the custom inspector.
- Dynamic Fog & Mist: recommended script for most situations.
- Dynamic Fog & Mist Exclusive: variant of the main script with Render Scale option which results in better performance on mobile.

2) Post-Processing Extensions
Support for Post-Processing Stack is included. This option requires Unity 2018.1 or later. You also need to have PostProcessing Stack V2 package installed (you can install it from the Package Manager). Then import the package named "PostProcessingSupport.unitypackage" included in DynamicFog folder. If you opt for the post-processing extensions, don't add the script to the camera: Dynamic Fog effects will be available as pluggable effects in Post-Processing Profiles and Volumes.

3) Custom Fog materials
A collection of materials and shaders are provided that have the fog effect integrated in their shaders so they offer the fastest performance available! However, if you choose this path, then you need to use these materials and not the image effects or Post-Processing Extensions above. Check the documentation for details.


Demo Scenes
-----------
There're at several demo scenes, located in "Demos" folder. Just go there from Unity, open them and run it. Remember to remove the Demos folder from your project to reduce size.
Important: since Unity 5.4, the Game View allows to scale the window. Choose "Free Aspect" to easily read the text of some of the demo scenes, otherwise due to the scaling feature demo texts could not be visible inside the window depending on the chosen resolution and your screen size.


Documentation/API reference
---------------------------
The PDF is located in the Documentation folder. It contains additional instructions on how to use this asset as well as a useful Frequent Asked Question section.

Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Dynamic Fog & Mist will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
