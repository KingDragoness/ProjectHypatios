Earth Current Geopolitical Condition



As of 2060, Earth is still under heavy Sixtusian influence. Since the fall of the Kaiser, many Sixtus occupied territories (protectorates, colonies, military administration) on Earth had been released, some to the status of satellite state and others totally independent but overwhelming of them are under Sixtusian economic dominance.

The MENA region (Middle-east north Africa) has been utterly devastated even to this day when both the Sixtusian Empire and the United Nations invaded and overthrow the Caliphate State during War of the Universe. The former countries of Gulf States, Yemen, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Sinai region and Israel was still under Sixtusian Outerboundary administration as “Sixtus Arabia States”. Almost all Jews in Israel had been expulsed from their own country since the Caliphate invaded Israel in 2032 and they either immigrates to Sixtus Core or Europe, not returning since the expulsion. To prevent any conflicts in the future, in 2037, SAS (Sixtus Arabia States) administration controversially decided to remove Israel, nullify the ‘holy land’ claim and replace it with State of Palestine.

East Asia becomes the wealthiest region on Earth, with China being the largest economy in the world with GDP of ¢60.2 trillion and per capita of ¢46,000. This was then followed by India with GDP of ¢28.35 trillion and per capita of ¢17,000.

Originally, while Sixtus introduced nuclear energy which nullifies the use of oil in transportation and energy sector, Sixtus imported many oils to manufacture plastic from Central Asia and Middle East. This all changes when War of the Universe ended with the Sixtusian Empire had open access to the United Dionary Empire’s massive natural gas and crude oil reserves which totally destroyed all of oil-based economy on Earth. Mobius Corps’ petrochemical division in UDE are responsible for 40% of the production of all plastics and oil extraction in the empire. An infamous quote from Kaiser when the Sixtusian Empire first arrived on Earth in 2016:

“When the humans asked what we want, I answered: Oil.”

Britain, United States and many countries that relies on financial sector has been totally squashed by the arrival of the Sixtusian Empire.

The economic situation in 2060:
•	Sixtus Arabia States and MENA: poorest region on Earth. Its average GDP per capita are around ¢2,100.
•	Western and Central Africa: ¢2,800.
•	Southern Africa and non-EAF East Africa countries: ¢3,600.
•	Central Asia: ¢4,000.
•	Central & South America: ¢5,300.
•	South-East Asia: ¢12,000.
•	East Africa Federation: ¢13,000.
•	South Asia: ¢16,000.
•	North America: ¢26,000.
•	Australia and Oceania: ¢32,000.
•	Europe: ¢38,000.
•	East Asia: ¢45,000.

European political situation isn’t exactly stable following War of the Universe. The increasingly unpopular monarch and growing power of the republicans supported by the Sixtusian Empire caused 2047 British Revolution which overthrows the British monarchy and replaced it with a social-capitalist government becoming Republic of Great Britain. Britain was then expelled from the commonwealth realm, joined numerous social-capitalist international organizations while Australia becomes the main country of the commonwealth realm.

Western Europe (including Spain, Portugal and Italy) was amongst the most unchanged region following Sixtusian arrival on Earth. Strong real economy of Western Europe that was not service sector made it able to survive Sixtusian’ economic dominance on Earth. Despite UDE bombardment and failed invasion attempt of Europe, Europe was recovering relatively quickly and its economy still head strong to the present day. There were still numerous political changes however, France and Germany are now ruled by a social-capitalist party for at least 10 cumulative years since War of the Universe. 

Central & Eastern Europe destruction caused by UDE was more severe although Poland, Czech, Slovakia and the Baltic States returned to status quo and lack any significant changes. In south-eastern Europe however, there were major changes with the return of Yugoslavia of all former Yugoslavia states with now Bulgaria entered the Federal Union of Yugoslavia. It was formed due to political fears caused by the Caliphate failed invasion of south-east Europe during War of the Universe. Greece, Albania, Cyprus and Turkiye were effectively nearly destroyed by the Caliphate and returned to the status quo after the war. 

United States didn’t join any battle or wars but it suffers from gradual economic downturn and political violence & unrest. United States became a hotbed for white supremacist extremism and southern ultra-nationalist. The 2049 American Insurrection caused a major destabilization for the United States where the Conservative Brotherhood Alliance launched a failed violent coup d’etat attempt with over 100k right wing militias takes arms to overthrow the government. The Confederate State of the South was successfully formed in 2051 with South Florida as the first state to entered the confederation. Since then, the rest of Florida, entire of Georgia and southern part of Alabama joined by 2060. There were Social-capitalist revolutionaries attempts to seize major cities by establishing a social-capitalist republic. 






Human’s Reaction to the Outer World




If humans in the past saw the Sixtusian Empire, the state of the universe, the existence of multiple lifeforms, Warp Gates and Elder Races could easily see it as madness and an absolute delusion; all of their history almost laid to waste and retrospectively, made human’s history insignificant. The world of today might seen as an absolute insanity, religions of Earth had been shaken, God’s existence is questioned, Human’s version of physics and science has been revised to keep on track with Sixtusian version. The once oblivious human which developed its own ways now its epoch and history has finally merged together with the rest of the galaxy.

For Kaiser, this is a gaslighting similar to how the Europeans colonized the world in the 19th and 20th century when rewrite the world or at least, the perception of the world from the eurocentrist view. The Sixtusian Empire essentially like that, it was retroactively undermining human’s history and its accomplishment, it was the preservation of native’s culture yet the treatment is more like obsolete, ‘exoticism’ cultural thing rather than consensus universality like science.






Salafism and the Caliphate





Simply known only as “The Caliphate”, the Caliphate was once the largest country on Earth before its collapse in 2035. The government type is a Caliphate Republic. The Caliphate power was all centralized on Pahliv Aul Said who held the title of Caliph or the Supreme Leader, his word becomes the highest law. The Caliphate was planned to be a democratic Caliphate republic once Pahliv dies or resigns. Its ideology is Islamofascism, pan-Islamism, anti-Salafism, Islamic modernism, Neo-Baathism, anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism and pan-Arabism. Pahliv staunchly rejected orthodox Islam and instead supporting syncretic form of it which he supports bi’dah, taking elements from other cultures and abandoning ‘obsolete’ Islamic values. Pahliv denounced Salafism and orthodox Islam as ‘degenerate backward vanguardist’, he denounced the Arab monarchs of petrol states as hypocrite, anti-democratic and traitor to the Muslims. He claimed:

“Our brother had been oppressed under the capitalism for long. Salafism and orthodox Islam supporters chanted the total enforcement Sharia laws without appropriation of the people. Sunnah is absolute! They spoke. They suppressed the intellectualism of the Muslim, the capitalists and imperialists had successfully tear us apart in order to profiteer themselves! We had every chance to unite under one state but those dogs give Ferrari, skyscrapers, Lamborghini and Louis Vuitton to these Sultan, emirs to suppress us, to corrupt our minds and destruction of the intellectuals in exchange for resources! Our people become workers, coolie not intellects! We must have the consciousness to attack against these wretched dogs who have tear us apart! All of our Muslim brothers must feel safe no matter where they go and unite under one religion, one Caliphate, one state! God is the greatest!”

Following a popular uprising, the Caliphate was formed and overthrow the governments of the gulf states in 2027, many of orthodox Islamist in the Saudi Arabia were purged, prisoned, killed or exiled.

It established itself as a revolutionary Caliphate to crush capitalism, restore the glory of the Caliphate era and restoring the golden era intellectualism by embracing science and technologies. Pahliv seek out for ‘reformation’ of Islam; he justified the reformation and bi’dah to confront against the Sixtusian Empire who threatened not only their religion but also the entire human race as its history going to be rewritten. Gaining significant political power, Pahliv enacted unprecedented progressive reforms however he antagonized other religions particularly due to how the West, China and Russia bows to the Sixtusian Empire after the Sixtusian had devastated Earth with its pathogens and later invaded Congo, North Korea, Venezuela, Mexico and other countries either for being a ‘failed state’ or close their economy.

Pahliv’s progressive reforms, crush of the orthodox Islam, crush of the corrupt Arab monarch and strong anti-Sixtusian stance made him extremely popular in the Muslim world and even other parts of the world. Despite a Sunni, Pahliv declared the Caliphate would be tolerant to Shia and issued fatwa to all Sunni to nullify all animosity towards Shia, however he declared non-Muslim as kafir and aggressively pursue for dakwah for the entirety of humanity. The United Nations and Sixtusian government were quite disturbed by the Caliphate fatwa’s of ramping up hostility of ‘non-believers’. Pahliv declared the famous tagline:

“Every Muslim in the world must feel safe no matter where they are in the world.”

Kaiser mocked the Pahliv’s quote directly taken Hitler’s ‘Every German around the world must feel safe’. According to Kaiser, Pahliv ideology is technically Islamofascism, in that it seeks to convert or eliminate anything that is not of their kind and attempting to establishing a totalitarian Caliphate Jihadist state.

In Pahliv speeches, he vows to drive the Sixtusian Empire out from Earth. His greatest fear is that the Sixtusian Empire will undoubtly overwrite the cultures and religions of Earth, launching a cultural genocide and turning humans into an empty soul, its history overwritten. The submission of the United Nations towards the Sixtusian Empire has caused Pahliv greatly questioned Earth’s sovereignty and how in just the span of around 10 years, humans becomes Sixtusian’ puppet.

The Caliphate upon took over, it retains Sixtusian factories and no trade embargo imposed however relations are hostile and ideologically contradicts with each other. It navigates itself carefully and avoids any provocation with the Empire until Citadel betrayed Pahliv in 2033 which he initiated invasion on all directions out of desperation. At its apex, the Caliphate spanned contiguously: entirety Maghreb in Africa; Andalusia Spain & Italian Sicily island in Western Europe; Serbia, Montenegro & lower Romania in South-eastern Europe; and to the furthest in east direction of Xinjiang region in China.

States under Caliphate:
-	The gulf states, Levant, Iraq, Egypt, Cyprus were under direct Caliphate rule.
-	Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan as ‘client state of Caliphate’.
-	Turkey, part of India, Bangladesh as ‘vassal state’.
-	Maghreb regions as ‘protectorate state’.
