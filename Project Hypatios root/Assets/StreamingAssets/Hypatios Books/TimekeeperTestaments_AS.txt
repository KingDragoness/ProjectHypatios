Earth Current Geopolitical Condition


As of 2060, Earth is still under heavy Sixtusian influence. Since the fall of the Kaiser, many Sixtus occupied territories (protectorates, colonies, military administration) on Earth had been released, some to the status of satellite state and others totally independent but overwhelming of them are under Sixtusian economic dominance.

The MENA region (Middle-east north Africa) has been utterly devastated even to this day when both the Sixtusian Empire and the United Nations invaded and overthrow the Caliphate State during War of the Universe. The former countries of Gulf States, Yemen, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Sinai region and Israel was still under Sixtusian Outerboundary administration as “Sixtus Arabia States”. Almost all Jews in Israel had been expulsed from their own country since the Caliphate invaded Israel in 2032 and they either immigrates to Sixtus Core or Europe, not returning since the expulsion. To prevent any conflicts in the future, in 2037, SAS (Sixtus Arabia States) administration controversially decided to remove Israel, nullify the ‘holy land’ claim and replace it with State of Palestine.

East Asia becomes the wealthiest region on Earth, with China being the largest economy in the world with GDP of ¢60.2 trillion and per capita of ¢46,000. This was then followed by India with GDP of ¢28.35 trillion and per capita of ¢17,000.

Originally, while Sixtus introduced nuclear energy which nullifies the use of oil in transportation and energy sector, Sixtus imported many oils to manufacture plastic from Central Asia and Middle East. This all changes when War of the Universe ended with the Sixtusian Empire had open access to the United Dionary Empire’s massive natural gas and crude oil reserves which totally destroyed all of oil-based economy on Earth. Mobius Corps’ petrochemical division in UDE are responsible for 40% of the production of all plastics and oil extraction in the empire. An infamous quote from Kaiser when the Sixtusian Empire first arrived on Earth in 2016:

“When the humans asked what we want, I answered: Oil.”

United Kingdom, United States and many countries that relies on financial sector has been totally squashed by the arrival of the Sixtusian Empire.
