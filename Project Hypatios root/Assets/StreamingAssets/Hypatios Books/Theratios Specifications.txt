Theratios is a high-level Ionis that has the ability to fly, launch fireballs and drop explosives. Protocol of the project enforced the insert of someone's personality to Theratios, in this case we used "ELENA" construct to maintain Theratios' personality and consciousness.

"ELENA" construct is a 25 year old Mobius Employee female human that died 3 years ago. The profile indicated she lacked any family and relatives.

A year ago, Elena was first born as an Ionis but a malfunction causes her to went rogue and caused '69 Incident in Hypatios Lab. The incident killed over 200 people, significant amount of Mobius Guards were slashed to their deaths by Elena's katana. The incident lasted a day before Elena was destroyed by the Heavenblazer mech operated by the director of Hypatios Lab, Vendrich. 

To prevent such incident in the future projects, many Ionis in stored were significantly nerfed, its personality are manipulated to be much more compliant to any Mobius staffs and its knowledge of the world will resembles of a "Human from pre-Sixtusian arrival on Earth in 2016".

Theratios is still rogue and is now stored safely inside a containment chamber but in case of emergency, now it can be killed anytime through the use of console command which can be entered and executed by any Mobius Lab members unless the lab director itself set up 'Emergency' flag which prevent Theratios from being able to be killed. In emergency mode, Theratios will be unshutable and only by accessing the Lab Director's user account can it deactivate all Ionis.
