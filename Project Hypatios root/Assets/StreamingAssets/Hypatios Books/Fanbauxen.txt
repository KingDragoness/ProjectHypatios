As a human scholar who studies Sixtusian culture and politics, I was greatly fascinated with the word: 'Fanbauxen', a famous Sixtusian word roughly means to: opportunist. It is used mainly perojatively, to describe people who are taking advantage of a situation.

This word was uttered significantly over the Sixtusian' Republic existence, many politicians like to use this word to accuse of its opponents as being more of a demagogue and populist rather pursuing its own goal and having its own merit. The word is a loanword taken from, you guess it: Bunderlife, the Sixtusian' state famous for its high intellectualism, philosophy and scientific output.
