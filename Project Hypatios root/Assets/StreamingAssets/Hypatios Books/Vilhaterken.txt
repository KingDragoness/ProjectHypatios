Vilhaterken is Sixtusian language means 'Will to Resist'. Most people lack the will to resist but the will to resist is actually originated from strong beliefs and independent thinking. Lust, materiel, power are things we need to resist and balance. A little of it is alright but too much will not be good for the individual. 

Our inability to resist, succumb our feelings and just follow our lowest, shallowest desires is tactical win but a complete strategic disaster for the individual. One must not simply easily lured to buy things, consume things too easily. We build abstract concepts, learn knowledge to establish our newfound resistance to do some things because in the long term we genuinely believe it will help us. It also indirectly causes the lowering of expectation. The more we are exposed to good things, the more we become numb to it. Best to leave the best later.

Gardavian Distance is a term means to establish significant distance from the real world and your beliefs. Pegging your life-long belief to some real-life people or materiel is absolutely dangerous because your plane of reality and illusions are blended together. 

-	If you believe in something materialistic, like cars, money, fictional characters that is made by some people or other, you will be obsessed in something you cannot control and most likely cannot own. Fictional characters or franchise medias (video games, films) is when the creators will one day disappoint or failing to meeting expectations causing the illusion of the franchise’s fans shattered.

-	This is a stark contrast compared to example; establishing a fantasy world in your head, you will allow a clear wall between reality space and your immutable fantasy of the world. Your fantasy world however, must be fed with real world information to correct your own fantasy world. Without fed with real world information and validations, your perception of the real world will be screwed.

-	People who only simply mimic their beliefs are incapable of doing critical thinking. They can easily swallow of the words of the preacher without thinking it thoroughly. 



-	Religion is actually one of the most notorious breeder of stupidity. Religion is somewhat an establishment or a shelter to allow echo chamber and cycling stupidity inside. Religious hermeneutics allows to take a piece of quote from a religious text and then spin in it up to whatever the person wants to do it for. 



[I. DISTANGLE CONNECTION]

Distangle your connection with the world will emancipate any biases of the real world and allows unbiased perspective of the world. 

By being in the world, you will find yourself easily swayed opinion of the people. Living in an empire of ever-increasing people and multi-racially diverse, it creates some kind of paradox. The mind no longer fixated on the inner-self but rather the environment and the people, hence communitarianism is supported in society. Distancing people from the world allows a better self-introspection and diving into greater level of consciousness. 

Anxiety is critical of allowing to assess of what’s wrong with us, having close friends validating your opinion is a bias because close friends had something to lose when they criticize you or had their biases. Mass society are at odds with your close friends in that they have no filter in criticism. There is no filter because your world with them are distant and very much different.

However, by distancing, is not by totally isolate yourself from the world but rather to be enlighten by someone who is knowledgeable of the world, a philosophers or intellectuals. By being in environment of stupid people, you will become stupid unless you raise the people around you to be intellectually the same as you. 

There is ambiguity in that if you are schizophrenic then you must have already ‘out of this world’ or out of touch of reality but the premise is simply false. Due to English language bias, people who are schizophrenic are not out of this world but rather it is delusional. It is delusional in the sense that your senses have overwhelmed you and is controlling your mind. The perfect quote is ‘to emancipate one’s perception from spacetime’, to be able to see the totality of the world from the lens of the Gods.
