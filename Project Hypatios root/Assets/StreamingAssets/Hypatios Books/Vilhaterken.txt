Vilhaterken is Sixtusian language means 'Will to Resist'. Most people lacks the will to resist but the will to resist is actually originated from strong beliefs and independent thinking. Lust, materiel, power are things we need to resist and balance. A little of it is alright but too much will not be good for the individual it concerns.

Our inability to resist, succumb our feelings and just follow our lowest, shallowest desires is tactical win but a complete strategic disaster for the individual. One must not simply easily lured to buy things, consume things too easily. We build abstract concepts, learn knowledge to establish our newfound resistancy to do some things because in the long term we genuinely believe it will help us. It also indirectly cause the lowering of expectation. The more we are exposed to good things, the more we become numb to it. Best to leave the best later.
