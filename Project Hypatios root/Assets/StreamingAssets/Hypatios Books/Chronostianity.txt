Chronostianity is a Zenithian system of thought and behavior originated in Great Lantorn Desert. The Chronostians worships Kronos as the God who controls time & space of the universe. The religion oriented heavily around the concept of time and unlike most Safarian religion, Chronostianity is a more of philosophical, rationalistic religion & critical thinking rather than promoting the cult of personality or a central figure. There was no ‘inventor’ of the religion, the most commonly accepted fact is that the origin of the religion was from the Zenith Federation in the 3rd century BC.

Chronostianity is highly decentralized religion, it was has its own denomination until merged together following Kaiser’s emergence. Chronostianity is a constantly evolving teaching meaning the teachings of the Chronostianity is works upon millenias of research of one’s perception of time, concept of time and study of entropy. The collection of Chronostian teachings collected in a book called Timekeeper Testaments.

One of the roots of secularism in planet Safar originated from Chronostianity, early Chronostianity tested out its theory through testable experiment and verify their teachings through empirical evidence. The heavy use of experimentation and constantly changing understanding of the meaning of time meant Chronostianity is Safar’s precursor of modern science.


I. BELIEFS 

Each denomination has widely different beliefs but there are several most essential feature is that almost all Chronostians believes:
-	Kronos is the central figure of Chronostianity. This is basically a monotheist religion. 
-	There are three planes of reality, the Fake World, Real World and Time World. Fake World is basically like the metaverse or cyberspace created by people in the real world. Time World is where God resides.
-	They believe greater plane of reality must exists 100% due to a ’glitch in the matrix’. This glitch of the matrix is the Warp Gate which are invented by the Elven and Titan race around 200k years ago without any clear record in the past and the recently discovered the first consistent and verifiable existence of Timekeepers which somehow allows people to remembers things after their death.
-	The universe has been intervened by beings that lives on the greater plane of reality. The universe supposed working like a simulation (Anima Naturalis; the being is natural and contained within that space and time) but the intervention of outside forces is similar to someone using a cheat code in video games and a change of the simulation.
-	Timekeepers no longer myth after Kaiser of Sixtus’ exploitative use of Machine of Madness. Timekeepers are Externum Anima; their soul has been lost in time and space.


Kronos

Kronos is described as the God who controls time and space of the universe. Before the 20th-century, Reformian Chronos and other branches has agnostic belief towards the existence of Kronos, however the discovery of Warp Gate and Kaiser’s Machine of Madness led to the total conversion of Kronos unbelievers to become believe the existence of God due to the ‘glitch in the matrix’. 


Denominations


Before the Kaiser of Sixtus’ rise, Chronostianity is divided into several major lines: 
-	Reformian Chronos
-	Orthodox Chronos
-	Pragmatics

The rise of Kaiser of Sixtus led to many existential crises for Chronostianity, the Machine of Madness led the total infalsible existential proof of the Timekeepers. Pre-Machine of Madness, Timekeeper is ambigious and literally never existed in older records. The proofing is impossible, a Timekeeper would certainly never committed suicide to proof the existence of time loop cycle hence causing many Timekeeper never realizes their potential. However, the Machine of Madness can turn back time which effects all Timekeepers.

This unprecedented phenomenon cause all Timekeepers to instant realization of their ability, hence why the Coalition of Timekeepers could only form after Kaiser’s use of Machine of Madness.


Ethics & Social


Chronostians values time above else. Pedis is boredom, to feel “May a minute felt like an hour”, this is regarded as “good”. Chronostian argued boredom is when creativity flourished and able to think critically better. Wasting time or time felt passing fast is called Alos, this is regarded as “bad”, being not bored is a state of ignorance. This is because the brain is constantly pre-occupied with the environment without space to relax & think critically. Incidentally, this focus on the environment meant Chronostian must thoughtful of one’s feeling and thinking. 

One must not always felt time is constantly passing quickly. Without sufficient contemplation of the surrounding environment, it will not be able to see the world clearly and had a narrow view of the world. Tiranose Kalos, is a phrase that describes a person would have a internal unrest due to constantly feeling Alos. Activities that removes the feeling of uselessness or time-passing too fast is called Alos Defusal, the goal is to move towards Pedis as much as possible. Time passing quickly can cause the feeling of unrest particularly the feel of being useless, it must be purged by doing something productive. Some Chronostians, may express guilt when they felt useless, one that felt he/she is a burden for other people would feel a guilty feeling of wasting one’s time. Being unpleasant to other people is also considered some form of Alos. Some hardcore Chronostian may even isolate themselves as further as possible to prevent becoming a nuisance to others. This practice make them highly careful of taking other person’s time.

Contemporary behaviour like playing video games, talking stupid to other people, ranting in the internet or simply hanging out with friends can be undesired for Chronostians, they prefer productive activities like reading books, studying, meeting new people for business connection or any productive tasks. For artisans, Chronostians feared creating a piece of work that is only for ‘fun’; ‘fun’ video games or entertainment product is unfavorable as they thought it was stealing other people’s time away with no productive value. Instead, they prefer to put out a product that is short to experience but very meaningful and impactful, in other words if you can teach a person how to do calculus in a week rather than a month, it is great deed.

Chronostians likened the idea of merging several things into one object if the reader or viewers can parse something much more quickly. An example is combining music and drama is capture an experience without having to read a lengthy novel.


Terminology
Major terminology used in Chronostianity:
-	Anima Naturalis (latin transliteration: ‘natural soul’): the being that is natural and is contained within that space and time.
-	Externum Anima (latin of ‘external soul’): essentially is Timekeeper, the being is unnatural and is coming from other time and space.


II. TIMEKEEPER TESTAMENTS

Timekeeper Testament is a two millenium collection of books compiled by Chronostian scholars. ‘Timekeeper’ is a once myth term that means a person who has the ability to explore beyond the worldly realm and see the world in multiple versions. While each denomination has different teachings, the Timekeeper Testament is the almost universally agreed teachings of Chronostianity.


Chapters
Timekeeper Testaments are divided into several chapters:
-	Concept of Time: Explaining how physics works, entropy, general relativity.
-	Perception of Time: How a living being feels time. Only from a mortal vantage point can understand time completely but the existence of Ionis and injection of knowledge may offset this understanding.
-	Hole in the Universe: The Warp Gate, Timekeepers and Machine of Madness. How Kronos may intervenes the simulation to enable ‘cheat codes’. These events cannot be comprehend, it is an insoluble phenomenon.
-	Kaiser and his Machine of Madness: How the Kaiser of Sixtus manipulated the world to his will through the use of Machine of Madness.
-	Coalition of Timekeeper: A faction consists of Timekeepers as a counter against the Sixtusian Kaiser. This records their witnesses and the struggle against Kaiser of Sixtus’ wrath.
