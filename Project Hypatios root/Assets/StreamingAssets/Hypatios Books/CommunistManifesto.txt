A spectre is haunting Europe – the spectre of communism.
All the powers of old Europe have entered into a
holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar,
Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German
police-spies.

Where is the party in opposition that has not been
decried as communistic by its opponents in power?
Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the
branding reproach of communism, against the more
advanced opposition parties, as well as against its
reactionary adversaries?
