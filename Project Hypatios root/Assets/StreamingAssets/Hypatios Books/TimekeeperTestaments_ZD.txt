Ionis and the WIRED

Ionis is created primarily to supersede the entire biological race. The internal clock of a biological being is heavily tied to the circadian rhythm, 24 hours; isn’t really compatible with hostile space environment and the lengthy space exploration. As warp drive is only possible on the planetary surface not in spaceships. Planetary warp gates are the only way for interstellar travel and constructing one means it has to travel to that planet using the fastest spaceship at 1/10 speed of light.

Meanwhile the WIRED is basically a very large server, big data that contains the information of every single person’ identity in the world. They were primarily maintained by Mobius Corps with the government heavily collaborates with Mobius. It records one’s face, personality, voice, history, body and other info every year. 

One could download construct of a person and emulate him/her in the smartphone or PC however due to a law within the empire, downloading or using someone’s living identity is strictly forbidden, so many simply circumvent this by synthesize a new construct with little modification from the cloned identity. The utility of someone’s construct can be used as a personal entertainment, to make AI voice or using 3d model of a person. The readily availability of 3d model of a person and affordable 3d printing are used by people to customize their own humanoid robots, usually for household purposes or at worse, malicious purposes. With humanoid robots becoming common and accessible, there were a large dedicated robot hobbyist across the empire. It is becoming similar in size as how there were large PC gamer enthusiasts before the formation of empire. 

Currently, the protocol to deploy an Ionis is the soul of an Ionis must be cloned from a real-life identity. The identity of an Ionis must cloned in from the WIRED in order to ‘de-noise’ the behavior, increase its predictability and ‘personality fallback’ so it will not stray too much when it went through machine learning.
