Forbidden Knowledge

The most central theme of Timekeepers is bringing a forbidden knowledge from the future and bringing to the past/present, causing a paradox. A forbidden knowledge has widely interpretation depending on one’s intelligence capability to comprehend it; it is relativism. 

Person that gains Timekeeper ability for the first time: to change the past. With temporality breaks down, one could attempt to experience many things previously unthought of or impossible to commit by non-Timekeepers. The amount of thing a Timekeeper can do to change a society are depends on what time of era it is in. Timekeeper in the ancient times will have lesser effect than in modern time where chaos theory is very prevalent in modern times. It ties back to basic philosophy where the whole world existence is basically stored in the collective consciousness of the masses. A billboard or a sign has no meaning for animals, only those who understands will it be stored in the people’s mind. Nudging things in modern times will ripples greatly across space and time.

With the Machine of Madness, these collective memories from previous timelines are stored in every Timekeeper’s minds (who is alive and obtained the Timekeeper ability at certain point of time). During Kaiser’s possession of the machine, Timekeepers were always notified before the time vortex activated, even those who were opposed the Kaiser. Kaiser has strict protocol for ‘rewinding time’, only rewinds it when it was absolutely necessary or the outcome of events were putting Kaiser at disadvantaged position.

The Machine of Madness had little to no recorded history before Kaiser’s possession. The advent of computer and internet blessed Timekeepers with ability to reliable and quick information handling which unlocks significant new abilities for Timekeepers. Timekeepers without the Machine of Madness, are essentially living in their own bubble which they can live freely from any Timekeeper interference. The Machine changed the fundamentals totally. The Machine reintroduced some kind of linearity to Timekeepers in which Timekeepers are at the mercy of the Machine’s time vortex and they are no longer in the bubble, the Timekeepers events were shared amongst them all. 

As a consequence of the Machine, information of the ‘multiverse’ (from previous timeline) are persistent and held in the collective consciousness of the Timekeepers. It is a block of information chained together, floated in every Timekeeper’s head.

“A Timekeeper is bringing a forbidden knowledge from the future. There a Timekeeper will upset the next timeline. Causing a paradox.”

To understand how Timekeeper can screw a world, we need to challenge our conventional epistemology. A Timekeeper paradoxically brings a piece of information to the past, screwing the past. But a raw of piece information cannot be swallowed raw by the masses. To be able to present it, a Timekeeper must serve the ‘meal from the future’ with whatever ingredients available in the past. One must cook it, present the information in the right manner depending on the historical era. A valid information is useless if one cannot present it in the right order. When it was presented well, one can potentially upset the past by bringing forbidden knowledge. 

“Even the right information but presented in the wrong order will only cause confusion. A piece of information is sticky to context.”

Abstract concepts are less entangled to spacetime, example: Mathematics are very abstract while sociology & economics are extremely sensitive to disturbance. One nudge can completely change the direction of the future.

“The hierarchical complex system from impossible to be nudged to the most extreme case of butterfly effect: Mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, social science. When deconstructing it to more abstract-level:”

“The law of math defines physics but not the way around.”

“The law of physics defines chemistry but not the way around.”

“And the law of biology defines psychology but not the way around. Basically, disciplinary linearity.”




Superformula and the Problem of Learning

The brain of an individual being is limited which made it impossible for Timekeepers to remember everything. The ability to a create some kind of Superformula is needed to learn and grasp every concept quickly. It is the ‘pattern’ that emerges in every discipline.

One of the prominent superformula is the ‘complex system’. It appears everywhere, one that has grasp on complex system will immediately able to analyze the subjects of many fields such as sociology, economics, biology, computer science, statistics and many others. 

But even with superformula, Timekeepers cannot simply learn everything and able to become a God. A Timekeeper cannot build a panzer or a tank if it has no industrial capability or the societal condition to trigger. It needs to shape its near environment by teaching the people in the past but this comes with the problem of ‘learning’.

To teach people to build a tank, requires a significant change of one’s societal condition or environment itself. We always have some problem of seeing the past from the present lens, hence we couldn’t even see the lens of the person who has never seen or even heard the idea of a ‘tank’. We need significant contextualization by giving instructions step by step. But the major problem is one’s imagination can be limited; to imagine is sometimes you need to build the material or the thing first. Contextualize a tank in the 1880s for example; imagine an artillery attached to a car then the car is made of steel. With that, people in that era can grasp the idea of it. But things like computer is completely unfathomable with that era, the only way to show it is by actually to show the thing. 

This is what is called ‘Impossible Imagination’, some things were simply impossible to be imagined by people. The notion of ‘imagination has no limit’ is bullshit. A person bend to the shape of the universe and reality first before diving into metaphysical stuffs. One does not comprehend or being conscious without becoming a being first; becoming a human or a robot that has the ability to think. 

When we see innovation, we see it as some kind of mankind’s ‘free-will’ but if we look the past from the present, we accept it as a status quo or ‘normalization’. Arabic numerals of 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 has effectively override our fundamental understanding of numbers and even math itself completely. When we introduced to Arabic numerals the first time, we may think it as revolutionary but overtime, we accept it and became ‘normalize’.

With atoms and energy constantly conserved and cannot be created nor destroyed, the world is not free but it is a determinist, contingency world. The imagination of a person is just the will of the future.




Chaos Theory, Emergence and Complex Systems

As a Timekeeper, we can see the parallels of the many universe, each with its own slight variations. Chaos theory is very visible for Timekeepers, in fact it is one of the first thing that we are able to notice. We saw living beings are extremely susceptible to changes, it is like chain reaction, its direction can be absolutely unpredictable and within just a week, events from far away that supposed to happened, changed because of the minuscule of our actions. However not everything is a butterfly effect. Things that Timekeepers wants to affect can be nullified by the “Opposite Forces”. These opposite forces are for example, you want to manipulate a person but then gets negated by their relatives or friends. A major event with lacking in complex system: earthquakes, volcanic explosion and asteroid strikes can be very predictable and very hard to be manipulated, it tends to be very persistent and no Timekeeper could even stop it unless they completely destroy the planet using nukes.

Systems with greater complexity are easily manipulated by Timekeepers. Systems that are complex are indicated by its non-linearity, emergence, spontaneous order, feedback loop. A Bunderlifean scholar explains regarding spontaneous order:

“Things seemingly stupid but if multiplied into millions will becomes intelligent. New properties emerge from dumb things. The input needs to be able to take from the output, allowing iterative changes and constant improvement. Chaos will accidentally create order.”

Every individual in the world have a task given to them. If all only do one task or only worked in agriculture then it will be a very unproductive society, instead every person must delegate its task to something, a function. A totalitarian state would be very ineffective form of government unless the leader is a God-like figure that knows a forbidden knowledge from the future (like the Kaiser). Usually a totalitarian system kills the imagination of a person, it takes a very naïve approach of only designing a society only from its surface rather than having faith on the populace to create emergence mechanics.




Existence of God

Basically, there are 4 possibilities for the existence of God: ‘God does exist’, ‘God never exist’, ‘God will exist’ and ‘God no longer exist’. ‘God does exist’ are basically theism, believes the existence of a greater deity out there. ‘God never exist’ are atheism or agnostic and doesn’t believe a greater deity out there. ‘God will exist’ are a belief that thinks the greater deity is our creation. ‘God no longer exist’ believes that either we have killed God or it no longer exist in this world.




Mind Fixation and The Destruction of Substance

The primary goal of Social Capitalism is to liberate the workforce and delegate manual labor to machinery. This somewhat ties to a concept that is originated from another disciplinary subject: Mind Fixation. The liberation of mind from trivial things is essential to liberate the workforce. It is to make one’s mind to focus on greater things rather than menial and obsolete things.

The consequence of shifting focus of one’s mind from real things to less tangible thing can be varied. In modern era, we are shifting our work from doing manual labor (manufacturing things, farming, fishing) to nonphysical work (content creation, investor, software developer). With it our mind becoming increasingly unable to grasp ‘trivial things’ like most people these days were unable to feel what it’s like to be in starvation for an extended period of time. While it is possible to be in starvation at any time, it is nearly impossible to be starve for maybe 1 month or more due to the epoch we are living in. The consequence is that the philosophical, story and moral ethics born out of a person living in starvation will be lost. The substance will be gone. 

Then there is a problem of why people in undeveloped countries cannot comprehend progressivism or sexual movements? This is because their mind hasn’t been liberated, stuck in conservative, status quo culture. Their consciousness has not been realized yet, they are in ‘lower-level’ of consciousness. They haven’t reached the point of being conscious or attempt to ‘role-play’ or empathize with those people. They most likely, being led to false consciousness where their mind has been fixated on the wrong things. With it, information and their ontology of the world has not matured yet, echo chamber narrowing their view of world. 

Another consequence is by doing replacement of our mind fixation with other things is the enablement of the state of forgetness, for example: our behavior with other people. When in a state of forgetness or an ‘NPC mode’, we do naïve approach to a person. In that state, we do not mind the emotion of the people in such depth, it did not analyze other people’s consciousness deeply. We are doing some kind of reductionist approach where we crush a person which are supposedly complex and has a long history of life to be reduced to a stereotype/an oversimplified identity.

An example during modern-day peacetime: the longer it lasts, the more people diverge and converges. Everyone’s ego will be increasingly diverging and every identity of a man will become widely different over time. In this era, people will become increasingly isolated, less communitarian, disoriented and disjointed with the world, everyone will be living in their own island. They will all find the world cruel and complicated. However, during war time, complex system collapsed. Society becomes conformist, individual’s identity will be crushed and everyone will be similar & relatable. 

“During peace, everyone was minding their own business. In a way they went into a state of forgetness, repressing one’s potentially of higher-level of consciousness; they have been embroiled in false consciousness. In here, I felt anxiety the most and, in a world, full of people that are disillusioned with reality.”

“But in the most unexpected way, in war, I find peace and love of the people returned back. Their mind no longer fixated on trivial, intangible things, now they have their mind fixated on the life of their own and their own kind. When you strip people from materialism, they started to contemplate on themselves. They have been liberated from the enslavement of materialism.”




Timekeeper Existence

The mechanism of Timekeeper and how it works never fully understood, many believe it was simply an error in the universe that all Timekeepers simply fully accepts. The study of Timekeeper works never mattered; it is perhaps a being that was thrown in to the world by God to see the effect of how much chaos will be inflicted if one could bring a forbidden knowledge from the future.

It is impossible to prove the existence of Timekeepers to mass society and only ‘blind faith’ of a man or telling one the right order of information can turn someone to believe the existence of a Timekeeper. Non-Timekeepers who didn’t believe Timekeepers existed were obviously could not be convinced with literal and direct information instead the Timekeepers must construct a narrative to convince one. As the Timekeepers themselves are an entity not entangled to space and time.

Timekeepers are basically emancipated from death. The limitation of time is now rendered obsolete. A man no longer fears of missing out. Identity change per death allowed a man to absorb a ‘forbidden knowledge’, to see what is it like to be other people.

In modern complex society, this become increasingly prevalent. With identities increases converges under the powerful economy of social-capitalism, many people feared the inability to experience many things. Timekeepers basically able to wear the mask of many identities, no longer it fears that it cannot experience to become ‘other people’. It is like trying role-playing every class/role in an RPG game.

A modern Timekeeper will be able to mold the many types of identities: a doctor, a radical, a girl, a boy, a celebrity or any identity. As a consequence of these identity changes, it gains knowledge previously missed in other identity; a Timekeeper will grow to become a rigorous critical theorist and develop perspective of the many. Learning holistically from all major social science like: psychology, history to economics & game theory, all will be essential in understanding a society in its totality. And in conjunction with its ability to order a set of information to a more coherent narrative, a Timekeeper can see pattern and view the world with from ‘God-like’ perspective.
