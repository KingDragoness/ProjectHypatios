Forbidden Knowledge

The most central theme of Timekeepers is bringing a forbidden knowledge from the future and bringing to the past/present, causing a paradox. A forbidden knowledge may cause different reaction depending on the people, its reaction will be depending on the conditionality of the world, its physical & mental state upon thrown into the world in a specified space and time, its comprehension of the world, its entanglement to the world and its motivation. 

When a person gains Timekeeper ability for the first time is to change the past. With temporality breaks down, one could attempt to experience many things previously unthought of or impossible to commit by non-Timekeepers. The amount of thing a Timekeeper can do to change things or experience many things are linked to how many people exists in a society during at certain space and time. Having Timekeeper in the ancient times will have lesser effect than in modern time where chaos theory is very prevalent. A Timekeeper in modern times will have a chance to change its identity as many times as it wants.

As a consequence of these forbidden identity changes and gaining knowledge previously unthought, a Timekeeper will grow to develop a rigorous critical theorist. Learning all major social science from psychology, history to economics & game theory, all will be essential in understanding a society in its totality.

The mechanism of Timekeeper and how it works never fully understood, many believe it was simply an error in the universe that all Timekeepers simply fully accepts. The study of Timekeeper works never mattered, it is perhaps a being that was thrown in to the world by God to see the effect of how much chaos will be inflicted if one could bring a forbidden knowledge from the future.
