Sixtusian Empire Economy

The tax haven states were completely eliminated by 2020. Kaiser’s invasion of tax-haven state to obliteration has effectively render offshore tax haven obsolete. Money in circulation all moved to more productive investment of the extraterrestrial industry. Government’s aggressive planetary colonization and rapid construction of space colonies enabled commodity explosion and massively increased Sixtusian’ manufacturing capability. By 2030, virtually all metal and rare-metals price on average dropped to 1/20 of the 2016 price, energy per capita is 180,000 kWh per person per year compared to 22,000 kWh in 2016.

Rapid shift to leftist economic policy meant the seizure of important industries that were on strategic national interest: mining, food, military and aerospace industries. Kaiser deprioritize some part of the economy in order to divert resources to more productive parts: the automotive industries (high-end cars), consumer electronics, food, shipbuilding and entertainment industry, all had its share of sector dropped. The shift from consumer to hard industries has caused mass layoffs and dislocate over 22 million Sixtusians from 2016 to 2020, a whopping 21% of the entire workforce. Space transportation and space colonies quickly becomes one of the major workforces, extraterrestrial civil engineers and spaceship engineer becomes one of the most essential workforce that highly contributed to the empire’s rise. 

Before the rise of Kaiser in 2016, economy of Sixtus from 1980s to 2016 was dominated by the service sector, accounted 60% of the GDP by 2016. Following Sixtus rapid space colonization, the Sixtus’ economy restructured towards reindustrialization: inequality greatly increases and the manufacturing & mining industry overtakes the service sector. Kaiser’s regime launched reforms to overhaul the financial system for the reindustrialization effort. 

Tax collection of the lower class was effectively eliminated, utility costs were totally eliminated only the up-front utility fee needed and foods were subsidized. These perks were only applied to ‘full citizen’ of the empire which has completed education and the conscription/social service. Several financial instruments that were changed, removed or added during Kaiser rule are the following: banning of cryptocurrencies, consolidate dozens of major banks to just 4 banks, deflationary currency, limiting circulation of M1, M2, M3 money supply while rapidly increase M0 money supply and implementation of war bonds during War of the Universe and Sixtusian-Alphanian War.

Kaiser’s regime was famous for its deflationary currency. Under his rule, Sixtus deliberately limited its printing of the money supply meanwhile massive commodity and productivity increases from Sixtus’ aggressive imperialism effort caused deflation. Kaiser argued even though one who deposits money will passively earn money, the rapid technological advancement from Dionarian, Elven and Titan race and the chaotic Kaiser’s rule will force everyone to spend thrifting or else risk being obsolete or fall.

Private creditors were definitely getting weakened by Kaiser’s deflationary policy; hence many banks become much more restrictive in its lending which caused Kaiser family-owned bank (Nexus Bank) becomes the dominant creditor of the Sixtusian Empire. It was a significant cut of the privately-owned bank and finance industry; insurance, creditors and venture capital were suppressed during Kaiser’s rule as the government becomes the dominant force of the financial sector.

The guarantee of holding Sixtusian Centurion will increase ~5% per year meant many people from all over the galaxy rapidly traded their homeworld currency with Sixtusian Centurion, this quickly destroyed the foreign reserves from Earth and Cassantor. Even though the Pentaempires of UDE, Alpha and Elistar Empire heavily restrict Sixtusian trade, many black markets from those empires propped up and becoming very powerful by illegally selling Sixtusian goods, currency and commodities which are significantly cheaper than their racial counterpart. This rapid adoption made the Sixtusian currency from 2% of the galaxy in 2016 to 60% by 2030. 

Majority of the empire’s income are coming from taxing the megacorporations, upper class and state-owned enterprises. Sixtusian biggest revenue SOE are in its mining, hard commodity production and construction industry, with this, the Sixtusian government had total dominance in producing intermediate goods of the hard commodity market. Due to Sixtusian economic dominance, most of private manufacturing companies that relies on metal or chemical buys commodities directly from the Sixtusian SOEs, this system makes the Sixtusian Empire had absolute monopoly on the commodity market.
