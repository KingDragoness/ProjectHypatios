Casualties of Kaiser’s Conquest

The casualties of Kaiser’s mad conquest is that most of deaths was caused by economic disruption and supply chain destruction; the worst of it was Sixtusian’ monopolistic control of the vaccines that prevents contagion; they had total control of pathogen elimination. In War of the Universe, total casualties reached over 3 billion, many that died was caused by biological warfare where the Sixtusian simply formed a highly secretive yet small unit biological specialist force of ~300 members that creates viruses that kills non-Safarian race; it was delivered secretly. 

To assert authority, the Sixtusian did the capitalist card trick by ‘Create the problem and sell the solution’, the Sixtusian both spread and cure the diseases. Since Safarian are not affected and the government is under Kaiser’s authoritarian rule, the diseases simply blamed on unconducive political conditions that disturb the supply chain and made it difficult to deliver the vaccines and medicines. The lesser races (Cassantors, Humans) are at the mercy of Sixtusian Empire, Dionarian are able to manufacture its own vaccines but thanks to its semi-feudalist society, its industrial capability was lacking and only produce for the upper classes. Only the Elven and Titan race were able to resist all biological threats completely.

By actively screwing up and fiddling politics of other nations, Kaiser knows this will destabilize those countries and cause immigrants to enter Sixtus. Kaiser remarks:

“Yes, I know by fucking around these countries I will cause them to enter Sixtus. But unlike hypocritical Europeans and Americans who dislikes immigrants but they’re the one who cause the migration, I from day one had likened the idea of immigrants or destabilize other country so that the Sixtusian Empire will gain free labors. Sixtusian’s social-capitalism is an ideology that believes on ushering true socialism, a true, very transparent and tangible goals. Those pesky idiot Earth westoid’s ideology and philosophy of ‘freedom’ and ‘democracy’ were pathetic and insufficient to convince the populace. Instead the only true goal is to achieve socialism, extract resources from space and build technology to delegate manual labour to machinery and liberate the workforce!”

As a consequence of being a Timekeeper, Kaiser is an accelerationist. Rapid iteration to rapidly advance technology while somewhat sacrificing social values and structure of society. Uberwelt, creating unified super culture is aimed to destroy pre-existing cultures that were inferior and potentially friction with cultures. 



Brainwash of Sixtusian Soldiers

Sixtus has a highly secular, moral and intelligent population this made it almost impossible to turn Sixtusian into a killing machine. But Kaiser ingenious technic to justify Sixtusian soldier to kill civilians is not by fear or terror but by twisting their fundamentals belief of the world.

Social-Capitalism basically teaches that everyone including foreign races such as humans, Titans, Dionarians, etc are obliged to be equally treated like the Safarians, the main race of Sixtusian Empire. With this, every race should treat like brothers and sisters because they are united in one common element: carbon lifeform. With this in mind, it is also taught that everyone is made up of atoms and then if they die, they decompose, disintegrate into disorganized atoms and will ‘return’ to nature.

The Empire teaches that when killing a person, they are not making that person de-exist or disappear, instead they are simply disintegrating and becomes unorganized atoms. Justification is that the atoms of Sixtusian are arranged in the ‘right’ order while their enemies are arranged in the ‘wrong’ order so in order to correct it, they must disintegrate them and return them back to nature. This is used from Sixtusian’ progressivism standpoint where abortion is very common if the pregnant child is discovered to be disabled; by killing it, you are able to prevent the future suffering of the child or put it in other ‘poetic’ words: the atoms of the future child will be in the wrong order so in order to correct, we must kill it, disintegrate it to return it to nature then pregnant another child and hopes the next child will be in the right order.



Deleted Timelines

With the Machine of Madness under Kaiser’s possession, it is inevitable that the Kaiser will use the Machine to conduct experiment or do some stupid things with it. Most of his experiments are social experiment intended as a joke or to see the reaction of ‘naive’ people he called. This included the notorious numerous summoning incidents of several ambassadors into the Kaiser’s Palace only to be called by racial slurs as an ‘experiment’. Or the other is insulting other religion like calling one of Dionary’s religion as a ‘Gay sex cult’ or the notorious ‘black ninja shinobi’ of burqa clothes.

His mad experiments are mostly quickly reversed using the Machine of Madness and only Timekeepers are the witness of these events. This is called the ‘Deleted Timelines’, timelines that were scrapped by the Kaiser, becoming non-canon events. 

This level of exploitation of Machine of Madness meant technically many things has already happened. The possibilities are possibly already happened, it just that, it was only witnessed by Timekeeper, making it overwhelmingly undocumented.


Send-Down Youth

With Sixtus move towards reindustrialization, the Sixtusian government initiated mandatory social programs for the youths to work in factories, mining or resource extraction. These social programs can replace half-time of mandatory military service. The Send-Down Youth program was needed due to Sixtusian corporations failed to attract young people to work, constantly vacant jobs even with attractive income and perks. Kaiser argued that the service sector and entertainment industry has grown like ‘cancer’ and caused people to become lazy, by dragging people from their ‘houses’ and establish totalitarian state Kaiser argued he could mobilize 

Failing to fulfill the social service will strip one’s perks and citizenship.
