In the Liquidator, we want everybody to relieve the stress of the capitalist society.


I. POEMS 

The work of the real world has taken a toll. The shittiness of the cruel real world has battered us.  Our egos has built the boundaries between each bodies, egoism separate us between the others. Now, in the darkness of Liquidator: Liquidate our solid bodies into liquid. In the liquid, our atoms will be mixing together, we will share our dreams, our lust, our desires and wants into one for this one moment.

Touch yourself together, physical touch. We shall feel the pain of others and all of their feelings. Delegate our anger to the abyss.
