Uberwelt/Superculture

Uberwelt or Superior Culture, is one of Kaiser’s ideological justification for Sixtusian imperialism and expansionism. Uberwelt are aimed to make a melting pot culture that takes elements from many cultures with the ultimate goal is to make a highly saturated colorful society comprised of many ethnics, race and religions which can make the society more complex, emergence mechanics and to expand the ‘greater entity’ of civilization. These are all ties to Sixtusian Empire main ideology of Social-Capitalism which by establishing a society with greater complexity will have the possibility of liberating the workforce.

To achieve the superculture or Uberwelt, it is to build a superior culture that recognizes the need of letting pockets of society exists with every group has its own purpose, interest and behavior however it needs a holistic narrative, a cohesiveness of the entire people where all agreed to some universal values, in Sixtusian case: liberate the workforce and delegate it to the machineries. By creating a grand narrative, it can greatly distract menial differences between contrasting cultures and focus on greater goals.

However, Kaiser’s ideological quest of liberating the workforce are halted by the feudalistic system of the UDE, Elistar, Alpha and the strong conservative religions. The UDE, Elistar and Alpha has been highly resistant against Sixtusian reform from semi-feudal to social-capitalism as it threatens destabilization and handed power to the masses. Kaiser argued feudalism while allows stability for centuries and reduce chaos, it prevents innovation and desaturate the color of society. Kaiser noted that Serfdom, slavery and caste are systems that will return if technology and societal changes were slow as it will make rulers to pursue materialistic things via conquest rather than expend its capital to develop its education and researching new innovations. 

On one example, Sixtusian heavy influence on Earth meant its ideology started permeated to Earth. It then greatly clashed with many conservative religions especially Islam. Sixtusian’ ultra-progressive society with its LGBT, secularism and liberalism becomes a point of contention for many religions on Earth. Pahliv Aul Said being a Timekeeper took an advantage of this and exploit it by moderating as the only person able to balance between implementing Sixtusian technology while retaining old Islamic values against Sixtusian Uberwelt influence which argued attempt to wipe the cultures of Earth. It then caused more significant problem by declaring the caliphate movement to overthrow the Sixtusian out from Earth. 

When asked about the problem of religions shortly after the fall of the Caliphate:

“I hate these retarded Caliphate that self-proclaims itself as an ‘repressed’ noble ‘Jihadist’ defender of the faith to protect itself from so-called scary ‘progressive’ society with LGBT, atheism and secularism. Idiots chanted to evict the alien Sixtusian Empire out from Earth. These shithole Islamic movement attempting to desaturate the color of society and crushing the complexity of society. All wears white or black clothes, forcing women to wear shitty Burqa black ‘ninja-shinobi’ clothes. Intellectualism are crushed, demagogue Islamic politicians uses the damn holy book all the time as the populist instrument to control the masses, unbelievers are persecuted, anything that is incompatible with their religion will be persecuted. But thank God, Pahliv Aul Said is at the very least, attempted to launch bi’dah or reformation/innovation like the Christianity with its Protestant revolution. And don’t even get me started with any of the ‘revivalist’ movement. Hermeneutics analyzer interpret religious texts or any political book and twist the narrative with mental gymnastics to whatever they like to build a new religious revivalist movement to ‘go back to its roots’. Revisionist idiots!”

The Sixtusian Empire has practically absorbed every value and tradition of all cultures. Even taking junk values and useless superstition. Kaiser, even though pragmatic, secular and doesn’t believe in any superstition remarked:

“Superstition works even though you don’t believe it.”

He explained that superstition works for traditionalist, cultural preservation which added the absurdism value in a culture. This absurd, seemingly useless superstition belief can act as a potential low-entry barrier interaction for connection with people, a shared value amongst differing cultures. Without the superstition or any of the values absorbed, there will be a situation where two very differing cultures will inevitably be clashed together greatly then it will fall into a great war. Absorption of trivial things was needed to adopt and understanding the culture of other and eventually, supersede the old inferior culture.





Kaiser’s Regime on LGBT and Polyamory

Kaiser’s position on LGBT is neutral and, infamously opportunistic. Under Sixtusian’ ultra-progressive society, Kaiser’s primary objective is to remove the strong influence of LGBT politics in order to shift focus on space imperialism, militarism and social-capitalism. He sees it as more of distraction and holding back Kaiser’s goals. He remarked:

“Sixtus has developed into a polyamory society where children are shared, family structure is an absolute chaos and everyone can basically fuck together with consent. This happened… decades before I went to power. Basically, the Sixtusian Republic during the junta regime are gearing itself towards service-based economy which destroyed the conservative family structure. The War for the End basically screwed everything by killing a lot of Sixtusian which upsets the nuclear family structure. Then, the polyamory movement takes off to allow the task of taking care of child will be more viable.”

“Essentially, polyamory is what 60% people today are. I won’t complain anything with that. The old family structure is simply obsolete, it is a legacy system that is inevitably to dissipate.”

In Sixtus, the practice of selling a baby was common due to economic system and its dynamic sexual relationship. A woman can choose to get pregnant from unmarried partner, gave birth to baby and legally sell it to a state-owned hospital, which earns them around € 90,000 - €120,000, 2 years’ worth of salary. The sold child if not adopted, will be under ‘government-care’ until it reached 17 years old.

Kaiser called Sixtus a ‘progressive liberal nightmare’ and possess ‘the most disgusting society system’ but Kaiser’s antagonism towards Sixtus’ ultra-progressive society was forcibly muted due to Social-Capitalism’ ‘liberating the workforce’ doctrine in that, Sixtusian society has destroyed its conservative family structure and become polyamorous in order to gain additional freedom, individualism and more time can be allocated to work rather than trivial bureaucratic structure of the old family structure; basically the ‘Berlin Wall’ nature of family structure is now torn down.

Kaiser stated with opinion about the LGBT:

“I don’t like this ridiculous notion of ‘Yes, I have found my true identity and gender’. It proclaims itself as finding one’s true self and finally found the so-called ‘true identity’. But why bending yourself to an identity and inventing ridiculous unpragmatic shit? To be clear, I am 100% believer that gender is social constructivism but the one thing I hate is they themselves confine their identity to the LGBT group. It is rather odd if they associate with that, why not being a ‘totally free independent being’ that is not associated with any group?  By becoming hot-headed non-ideological person is closer to become your ‘true identity’. For that is closer to true emancipation of one’s self.”

“For me it is apparent clear. For most, they joined that group is the same tribal doctrine of ‘my tribe’. Same interest means we will help each other, that’s it. And there is nothing with that but don’t proclaim with pretentious philosophical shit of ‘gaining true one’s self’ or ‘this is my true gender’ shit.”





Kaiser’s Self-Centeredness Problem

Kaiser disliked the idea of self-centeredness, self-care or the idea of loving yourself. He remarked on the issue:

“Self-centeredness is retarded concept led by fatfuckers, LGBT movements or other idiots that attempt to justify its laziness and immobility towards greatness. Hiding behind its identity and its inferiority is the epitome of a person who is incapable of change. People who don’t build sufficient feedback loops to correct itself; not being in anxiety and stays in the status quo of mediocrity will be drown in their own biases, world view confined to their own views and an echo chamber.”

“People who are in the social circle of un-improving and lack of hurtful, spicy comments for feedback are stuck in a vicious circle. Recycling of the same opinions. Community acts like ‘Berlin Wall’ to protect a person from the outsider, even though the outsider may give valuable lesson. Hence, this circling inside the community is devil’s circle that can worsened biases, leaving permanent flawed idea to their own brain to the point when you’re an adult, you cannot grasp new concept and idea anymore.”

For the Kaiser, balancing between individualism and communitarian is important. In line with Social-Capitalism, Kaiser believes that self-centeredness must in the right balance so that the individual identity can be preserved for small innovation, attack against the system while some kind of outsider feedback can be used to improve one’s self and to be better in retrospective of one’s self.





Repressed Consciousness of the Masses

In a society, everyone has their own repressed negative behaviours in order to keep the harmony society in tact however a pattern will emerge hence that common repressed behavior is the ‘repressed consciousness’. 

In sexual relationship, many people like threesome or interchangeable sexual partners but usually the legacy system of the old society prevented people to conduct such behaviour or action. In Sixtus, p is the most common type of relationship, people able to conduct casual sex with many people without significant consequences. Sixtus was able to liberate much of the social barriers hence many repressed consciousness of the masses had been liberated compared to other societies. By doing artificial social barriers, they have repressed their own desires. When these repressed desires accumulate, it will snowball people’s frustration towards the system and if left untreated, there will be major societal consequences, i.e: Repressing sex will cause fertility collapse.

Sixtusian society had reorganized itself to bring a total ‘destruction’ of its conventional and conservative relationship structure. The old family structure of 1 man and 1 wife is a legacy system that have been ‘purged’, it was incompatible with current technology and economic system as cited by Sixtusian sociologists. 

Kaiser had numerous warnings to any countries that attempt to adopt highly advanced Sixtusian technology while staunchly defend its cultures and not adopting Sixtus’ social-capitalism society structure:

“To steal, to make is easy but to innovate from scratch while retaining your pathetic culture and way of thinking is impossible. The Sixtusian able to rise this fast only because it liberated the repressed consciousness of the masses. If you do not liberate it, then you will only cause false consciousness; a misalignment and disconnection with reality.”





Eternal Stage of Social-Capitalism

The primary premise of Social-Capitalism is that it assumes a country will stuck in an eternal stage of shifting between centralization and decentralization policies. It assumes the importance of both welfarism and centralization of wealth to the ruling class. The idea of accumulation of wealth is good because it can concentrate the wealth to create some projects which can potentially benefits the masses. Meanwhile the idea of distributing wealth is good because it allows small people to contribute society’s complex system to have adaption, feedback loops and emergence which can innovate.

The Sixtusian Empire is the only empire that adheres to this ideology. Other empires like Elistar, United Dionary Empire, Alpha Empire which has existed for thousands of years all developed into semi-feudalist empire with caste system and strong separation of classes. This is because feudalist structure allows high stability at the cost weak reforms and low innovation. The caste system allows for highly efficient society which the labour is properly divided from one’s birth. With this, the Elistar, UDE and Alpha has practically turned its working class to a total alienation where they all has lost the ability determine to its own life and destiny.

When the UDE lost the War of the Universe in 2036, the Sixtusian Empire forced the UDE to open up its economy and rapidly introduced new machinery which fundamentally changed UDE’s social-economic structure to social-capitalism, causing a massive chaos. Sixtusian reforms to UDE’s economy is using Dionarian as their cheap labourers while the Sixtusian gradually becomes the capitalists, dictate the goods to be produced, hence liberating Sixtusian’ workforce. These had major consequences.

First, Sixtusian forces all UDE’s subject states to major land reforms. UDE subjects that were republics or had high liberty are fundamentally unchanged by this policy but monarchy-like subject states which are the dominant government form of many UDE’s subjects quickly fall into chaos. The unrealistic high targets issued by Sixtusian government to UDE monarchy-like subject state was unable to keep up. To enforce this, the Sixtusian Outerboundary government randomly picks one of the ruler’s family to be killed if the demands are not held. However, when the demands able to keep up, the lower class of Dionarians were revolting against their landlords and aristocrat classes. Some places Dionarian launched massive classicide against the upper class, causing the Sixtusian Outerboundary to forcibly take control of the vacant government.
