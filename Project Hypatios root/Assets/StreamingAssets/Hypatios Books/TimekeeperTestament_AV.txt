Uberwelt/Superculture



Uberwelt or Superior Culture, is one of Kaiser’s ideological justification for Sixtusian imperialism and expansionism. Uberwelt are aimed to make a melting pot culture that takes elements from many cultures with the ultimate goal is to make a highly saturated colorful society comprised of many ethnics, race and religions which can make the society more complex, emergence mechanics and to expand the ‘greater entity’ of civilization. These are all ties to Sixtusian Empire main ideology of Social-Capitalism which by establishing a society with greater complexity will have the possibility of liberating the workforce.

The anti-conservative culture of Sixtus is primarily stemmed of Safarian race 900 years (from 1000 AD -1900 AD) of cultural and technological stagnation primarily caused by Elistar Empire impose a peace in Safar through Eltravivor Empire as its proxy state. The Elven race has manipulated the geopolitics of Safar into an eternal perpetual war between Salatan and Eltravivor Empire as it becomes a somewhat an entertainment for the Elven. The gridlock situation was finally broken with rise of Social-Capitalism and Communitarianism movements in the 19th century. Both of these socialist forces combined forces to launch independence movements against Eltravivor, culminating in War of the End from 1967-1975 which ended up with then Sixtusian forces launched a large-scale systematic genocide against the Eltravivor from 1975-1984 for being ‘traitor for the Safarian race’.

The socialist movement of Safarian race in the 19th century was noted with an incredible amount of luck, mass organization and the ability to repulse against Elistar & Eltravivor Empire. It is revealed that Machine of Madness was taken away by the Eltravivor Empire in 1901 which afterwards, the coordination and movement of the rebels became way less efficient and more disorganized. This meant some Timekeeper in the end of the 19th century, has successfully coordinate movements to launch an inevitable doom for the Eltravivor Empire.

To achieve the superculture or Uberwelt, it is to build a superior culture that recognizes the need of letting pockets of society exists with every group has its own purpose, interest and behavior however it needs a holistic narrative, a cohesiveness of the entire people where all agreed to some universal values, in Sixtusian case: liberate the workforce and delegate it to the machineries. By creating a grand narrative, it can greatly distract menial differences between contrasting cultures and focus on greater goals.

However, Kaiser’s ideological quest of liberating the workforce are halted by the feudalistic system of the UDE, Elistar, Alpha and the strong conservative religions. The UDE, Elistar and Alpha has been highly resistant against Sixtusian reform from semi-feudal to social-capitalism as it threatens destabilization and handed power to the masses. Kaiser argued feudalism while allows stability for centuries and reduce chaos, it prevents innovation and desaturate the color of society. Kaiser noted that Serfdom, slavery and caste are systems that will return if technology and societal changes were slow as it will make rulers to pursue materialistic things via conquest rather than expend its capital to develop its education and researching new innovations. 

On one example, Sixtusian heavy influence on Earth meant its ideology started permeated to Earth. It then greatly clashed with many conservative religions especially Islam. Sixtusian’ ultra-progressive society with its LGBT, secularism and liberalism becomes a point of contention for many religions on Earth. Pahliv Aul Said being a Timekeeper took an advantage of this and exploit it by moderating as the only person able to balance between implementing Sixtusian technology while retaining old Islamic values against Sixtusian Uberwelt influence which argued attempt to wipe the cultures of Earth. It then caused more significant problem by declaring the caliphate movement to overthrow the Sixtusian out from Earth. 

When asked about the problem of religions shortly after the fall of the Caliphate:

“I hate these retarded Caliphate that self-proclaims itself as an ‘repressed’ noble ‘Jihadist’ defender of the faith to protect itself from so-called scary ‘progressive’ society with LGBT, atheism and secularism. Idiots chanted to evict the alien Sixtusian Empire out from Earth. These shithole Islamic movement attempting to desaturate the color of society and crushing the complexity of society. All wears white or black clothes, forcing women to wear shitty Burqa black ‘ninja-shinobi’ clothes. Intellectualism are crushed, demagogue Islamic politicians uses the damn holy book all the time as the populist instrument to control the masses, unbelievers are persecuted, anything that is incompatible with their religion will be persecuted. But thank God, Pahliv Aul Said is at the very least, attempted to launch bi’dah or reformation/innovation like the Christianity with its Protestant revolution. And don’t even get me started with any of the ‘revivalist’ movement. Hermeneutics analyzer interpret religious texts or any political book and twist the narrative with mental gymnastics to whatever they like to build a new religious revivalist movement to ‘go back to its roots’. Revisionist idiots!”

The Sixtusian Empire has practically absorbed every value and tradition of all cultures. Even taking junk values and useless superstition. Kaiser, even though pragmatic, secular and doesn’t believe in any superstition remarked:

“Superstition works even though you don’t believe it.”

He explained that superstition works for traditionalist, cultural preservation which added the absurdism value in a culture. This absurd, seemingly useless superstition belief can act as a potential low-entry barrier interaction for connection with people, a shared value amongst differing cultures. Without the superstition or any of the values absorbed, there will be a situation where two very differing cultures will inevitably be clashed together greatly then it will fall into a great war. Absorption of trivial things was needed to adopt and understanding the culture of other and eventually, supersede the old inferior culture.

To establish a healthy culture, Kaiser issues a mandate that every citizen must engage in the third place (community place) every week for at least 2 hours, any places including bars, cafes, community centers or parks. Failing to commit 104 hours of ‘community time’ or any ‘social service’ in a year will impose an income tax of 5% and some perks removed for the following year.




Kaiser’s Repression of Progressives’ Political Consciousness




Upon Kaiser’s rise to power, Sixtusian ultra-progressive society are poising a major threat to Kaiser’s imperialist ambitions. To shut down the oppositions, Kaiser employed the Totalitarian Youth to crush the influence and repress the political movements of the liberals, ultra left socialists and progressives. The accusation that Kaiser is anti-LGBT, TERF or anti-liberals by the progressives is blatantly wrong rather his totalitarianism style rule equally repress every single political movement including the conservatives, LGBT, any religion, ethnics and race. Instead, Kaiser was not a dogmatist ideological vanguard, he rather takes any policies from every political ideology can help to raise the empire quickly.

The early era of his rule, Kaiser’s primary objective is to remove the strong influence of Sixtusian LGBT politics in order to shift focus on space imperialism, militarism and social-capitalism. He sees it as more of distraction and holding back Kaiser’s goals. He not only sees progressivism a distraction but also the others:

“Islamic cultures are repressing intellectualism and secularism on Earth. Combined with its rapid population growth, it is a cancer that needs to be eliminated through chemotherapy. Some ‘good’ cells will die and some ‘bad’ cells will die.”

Sixtus has developed into a polyamory society where children are shared, family structure is non-existent and everyone can have consensual sexual relationships without any constraints. Sixtusian nuclear family structure was unsustainable beginning from its inception, then The War for the End from 1967 to 1975 is the final nail in the coffin that led to the destruction of conservatism in Sixtus and the rise of progressvism. Since then, the polyamory movement takes off which enabled overlapping ownership of a child. At the current stats, over 60% people currently claim in a polyamory relationship.

As a consequence of this, selling a child was common. Abortion was rampant and the lack of strong bonding meant the child usually sold to the government. When the sold child if not adopted, it will be under ‘government-care’ until it reached 17 years old. 

Kaiser called Sixtus a ‘progressive liberal nightmare’ and possess ‘the most disgusting society system’ but Kaiser’s antagonism towards Sixtus’ ultra-progressive society was largely muted due to his vanguardist stance of Social-Capitalism’ ‘liberating the workforce’ tenet in that, Sixtusian society has become more productive by destroying its conservative family structure, become polyamorous and the torn down of ‘Berlin Wall’ of family structure. The breakdown of conservative social values allows unique economic activities that is not seen in other countries. This caused comparative advantage and innovation, which the Kaiser absolutely needed to raise the empire:

“We gain money by doing what the other not doing.”

Despite his anti-progressivism, nevertheless Kaiser disliked the idea of where the family structure wall is strong but the parents only having one child, he remarks:

“Having one child, is worst for the parent and worst for the child but the best for capitalists. No siblings and parent overreliance on one child. By stripping the family, the child will be in alienated and isolation hence easily manipulated by the mass society. For me, the dynamic of both family and mass society must equal and balanced.”

In the matter of LGBT according to the Kaiser, LGBT radicalism in Sixtusian Empire is primarily caused by social constructionism that had beneficial for heterosexual, so LGBT people are disadvantaged people who revolts against the system. For some, being an LGBT or creating of one’s gender is to find one’s true identity. However, the Kaiser utterly opposed the philosophy of LGBT of ‘finding true identity and gender’, he believes that ‘existence precedes essence’ in that one becomes influenced more by the environment. He remarked:

“I don’t like this ridiculous notion of ‘I have found my true identity and gender’. I found people who attempts to reorient its sexual orientation were taken into too much into the metaphysical realm and abandoning the materialist/real world by rejecting introspection of one’s self. They become detached from reality that they became biased of their own making.”






Kaiser’s Self-Centeredness Problem




Kaiser disliked the idea of self-centeredness, self-care or the idea of loving yourself. He remarked on the issue:

“Self-centeredness is retarded concept led by fatfuckers, LGBT movements or other idiots that attempt to justify its laziness and immobility towards greatness. Hiding behind its identity and its inferiority is the epitome of a person who is incapable of change. People who don’t build sufficient feedback loops to correct itself; not being in anxiety and stays in the status quo of mediocrity will be drown in their own biases, world view confined to their own views and an echo chamber.”

“Hence, this echo chamber that exists within these community is devil’s circle that can worsened biases, leaving permanent flawed idea to their own brain to the point when you’re an adult, you cannot grasp new concept and idea anymore.”

For the Kaiser, balancing between individualism and communitarian is important. In line with Social-Capitalism, Kaiser believes that self-centeredness must in the right balance so that individuality can be retained while criticism can be used to improve one’s self and to be better in retrospective of one’s self. The realm of the metaphysics and the materialist must be balanced.





Repressed Consciousness of the Masses





In a society, everyone has their own repressed negative behaviours in order to keep the harmony society in tact however a pattern will emerge hence that common repressed behaviour is the ‘repressed consciousness’. 

From many studies, it is showed that many people like group sex or interchangeable sexual partners but the legacy system of the old society prevented people to conduct such behaviour or action. In Sixtus, polyamory is the most common type of relationship, people able to conduct casual sex with many people without significant consequences. The total liberation of repressed desires of the masses enabled Sixtus to do many things that other societies can’t, gaining a major comparative and competitive advantages. 

Sixtusian society had reorganized itself to bring a total ‘destruction’ of its conventional and conservative relationship structure. The old family structure of 1 man and 1 wife is a legacy system that had been ‘purged’. Many have argued the change was primarily caused by economic system and societal reforms.

Kaiser had numerous warnings to any countries that attempt to adopt highly advanced Sixtusian technology while staunchly defend its cultures and not adopting Sixtus’ social-capitalism society structure:

“To steal our technology is easy but to innovate from scratch while retaining your pathetic culture and way of thinking is impossible. The Sixtusian able to rise this fast only because it liberated the repressed consciousness of the masses. If you do not liberate it, then you will only cause false consciousness; a misalignment and disconnection with reality.”

Before Kaiser’s rise, the hikikomori (Japanese term for being confined; severe social withdrawal) was common amongst Sixtusian youth however Kaiser launched the Totalitarian Youth and “Send-Down Youth” programs which radically eliminates many socially isolated young people. Kaiser rejected that socially isolated people are incapable of social activities or physically/mentally inferior, Kaiser much more believed that these people were simply brought onto the wrong consciousness that is damaging to these people, he remarked:

“A naïve person must be clashed with reality and they must dragged out from their homes. Introducing an artificial boundary or wrong type of consciousness will lead a person to their doom. You tell them X and obey to it because the society told you to do it. You have dictated by the dictatorship of the masses. Mass society has successfully reduced you into an NPC, a generic pathetic people.”

“It is unacceptable that we have turned like this. When the big people make mistakes, you the pathetic one must grind your face to the asphalt road. There must some kind of rejuvenation of the spirit. People are isolated becoming easy to divide and conquer. Becoming capitalist’ prey. The youth was given the wrong consciousness, a materialistic consciousness to distract them from becoming the greatest version of one’s self. They give you stupid entertainment and false political movement, becoming the worst of yourself.”

Socially isolated people are argued by Kaiser being led into the worst version of one’s self. They lay down at home, becoming lazy, unproductive and unhealthy. When these type of people becoming a lot, there will be a repressed consciousness shared amongst hikikomori. These hikikomori can be weaponized if handled well according to the Kaiser: 

“There are a million of socially isolated people and ‘degenerate’ people. An unused, idle people waiting to be mobilized. I simply cannot have idle people do nothing hence they must dragged out from their homes. Joining the Totalitarian Youth will rejuvenate them. Without doubt the retarded progressive movement and conformist behaviour has isolated many young people hence I will pit these two in the gladiator arena to fight each other. A net good. For the socially isolated people as they will be resuscitated into a fresh, functional citizen. For me, the political circus, ‘filibustering’ of the progressives is dead.”

“No longer they became the retards of society. Instead, they all became the greatest version of themselves. The beasts have been unleashed.”

Liberation and shatter the rules of conformity allowed for social liberation. The people no longer stuck in a gridlock where they are able to express themselves. While the gender movement self-proclaims itself as freedom of expression, Kaiser rejected these claim as a distortion and only creates unnecessary societal complexity which creates a lot rules which then made people becomes reluctant to engage social behaviour. By reducing and crushing complex identity to one (as in military), people are much communitarian, easy to understand each other. But in line of Kaiser’s support for complex society, he noted crushing identity must only be temporary as reducing complexity of a society will reduce innovation.




Eternal Stage of Social-Capitalism




The primary premise of Social-Capitalism is that it assumes a country will stuck in an eternal stage of shifting between centralization and decentralization policies. It assumes the importance of both welfarism and centralization of wealth to the ruling class. The idea of accumulation of wealth is good because it can concentrate the wealth to create some projects which can potentially benefits the masses. Meanwhile the idea of distributing wealth is good because it allows small people to contribute society’s complex system to have adaption, feedback loops and emergence which can innovate.

The Sixtusian Empire is the only empire that adheres to this ideology. Other empires like Elistar, United Dionary Empire, Alpha Empire which has existed for thousands of years all developed into semi-feudalist empire with caste system and strong separation of classes. This is because feudalist structure allows high stability at the cost weak reforms and low innovation. The caste system allows for highly efficient society which the labour is properly divided from one’s birth. With this, the Elistar, UDE and Alpha has practically turned its working class to a total alienation where they all has lost the ability determine to its own life and destiny.

When the UDE lost the War of the Universe in 2036, the Sixtusian Empire forced the UDE to open up its economy and rapidly introduced new machinery which fundamentally changed UDE’s social-economic structure to social-capitalism, causing a massive chaos. Sixtusian reforms to UDE’s economy is using Dionarian as their cheap labourers while the Sixtusian gradually becomes the capitalists, dictate the goods to be produced, hence liberating Sixtusian’ workforce. These had major consequences.

First, Sixtusian forces all UDE’s subject states to major land reforms. UDE subjects that were republics or had high liberty are fundamentally unchanged by this policy but monarchy-like subject states which are the dominant government form of many UDE’s subjects quickly fall into chaos. The unrealistic high targets issued by Sixtusian government to UDE monarchy-like subject state was unable to keep up. The enforcement by the Sixtusian Outerboundary to the local ruling class were brutal and when the local rulers successfully met Sixtusian’ demands usually met with a revolt by the lower class of Dionarians against their landlords and aristocrat classes. Some places Dionarian launched massive classicide against the upper class, causing the Sixtusian Outerboundary to forcibly take control of the vacant government.
