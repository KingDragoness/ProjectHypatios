Kaiser’s Problems Towards Religions

During Sixtusian Occupation of Earth, King Dragoness’ regime has major problem with Islam, especially its political movement. Pahliv Aul Said being a Timekeeper has caused significant problem by declaring himself Caliph and his caliphate movement. The Kaiser regarded the religion as the most toxic religion that cannot be removed but must be ‘neutralized’ by the empire. 

When he was asked in an interview about Pahliv’s regime shortly after the Caliphate’s fall, he responded:

“The Caliphate is a just another rebel group. The Caliphate pretend itself to be ‘Oh! Rise up my brother! It’s jihad time my friend! We- we must rise up against the oppression of this alien, Sixtusian Empire and remove elements of colonialism! Oh, we are going to get colonized by Safarian aliens!’. All of these idiots do is simply resisting technological and societal progress. It is without doubt inferior cultures will become obsolete particularly if the cultures have too many rules and restrictions. Few of Earth’s culture will retain but the retarded ones will be gone, like the forcing women to wear black ninja shinobi clothes all the time or in another religion, women become second-class citizen or in another, women become conformist and slave to the man. This multiculturism, cultural preservation like UNESCO is idiot. Every culture is trash.”

Kaiser had main ideology is the Uberwelt, ideology meant superior culture; this superior culture was a critical part of the Sixtusian Empire expansion which meant all cultures melded into one super culture which takes it from every culture however thanks to religion, Islamic countries was in particular highly resistant against assimilated into Sixtusian culture particularly Sixtusian populace’s pro-LGBT, majority atheist state and anti-religion. Religious cultures are protectionist, isolationist and orthodox in its nature, effort by the Kaiser was futile and it was very hard to ‘replace’ the culture.

Kaiser absolutely hated religions that is not compliant to Kaiser’s version of super culture. Many of Islamic culture, customs and ideologies directly against Sixtusian values. This caused friction with local Sixtusians. When immigrants started to flow in to the empire after the Caliphate collapsed, their refusal to abandon their custom, the hot-headed and ‘self-righteous defender of the faith’ behavior inhabited by many of its followers clashed with Sixtusian local citizens. Riots were widespread. Sixtusian politicians somehow mitigate this by creating special district and send them to King Canyon Town which is a city overwhelmed with immigrants. However, the KCT city quickly sprawled into one of the most dangerous cities with both being the poorest and highest crime in the entire nation, every month there’ll be an interethnic/religious violence between Muslim or/and other immigrants. Kaiser blamed their idiocy and orthodoxy of not abandoning their customs and absorbing Sixtusian culture for their suffering.

In Kaiser’s observation he saw the religion’s orthodoxy and haram-ization of bi’dah has caused these Muslims to be intellectually backwards. People inside the faith has severe restriction or at least feared reprisal or afraid committing of sins. To do anything they must consulted to their local religious leader to adhere the conventional pieties. Kaiser believes these convoluted systems with a thousand pages holy book made it impossible for normal people to read. The worse of it is when a believer of a religion are forbidden to learn from a book or other religion even though that may contain an important lesson. Kaiser remarked:

“These idiots will call people unbelievers, atheists or kafir, whatever these morons want to say just because a man is curious or thirst of knowledge. But one thing I found the most ridiculous is the idea that EVERYTHING must come from the holy book as the primary source, de facto, the truth of the world. If Chronostians were forcibly convert to that religion, all of Chronostians will commit seppuku.” 

Further, the mandate issued by religion is regarded by the Kaiser as ‘idiotic’. In one of his interviews with the state media, he called them and other religions out: 

“You have idiots clinging their faith to millennium-old religion. Then every religion, has these ‘reformers’ and ‘orthodox’. These two factions basically it said itself, one wants to reform to better adapt to the new society or the orthodox are basically conservatives who wants to going back to the fucking roots or whatever. If you look the retarded Marxist, Fairtolic, Safarian Communitarianism, Chronostianity, is the same shit, you have one side says, ‘oh We must going back to the roots! We must adhere to the old values!’ then you have idiot hermeneutics analyzer analyzes biblical texts, Communist Manifesto, religious texts to interpret or ‘tafsir’ the texts and twisted them with mental gymnastics to fit with the ‘new political revivalist movement’. Faggot revivalist movement like the Salafist, Jehovah or basically any political movements is technically just to make the poor bastard to be brainwashed and be ruled by the elites.”

The Kaiser noted the religion is big is not necessarily it was good but rather the religion is to enlarge via populist promises. Hermeneutic analyzer did some revisionist movement that appropriate the religion to be more accessible to the masses according to the current condition of the world.
