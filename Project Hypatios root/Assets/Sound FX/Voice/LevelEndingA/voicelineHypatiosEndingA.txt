I must commend your endeavour in doing this test. You have successfully prove yourself as the true Timekeeper.

Nevermind about the Timekeeper. What is important is your determination to complete the test.

Especially after suffering many pain and 'oddities' across your journey.

These oddities I refer is primarily shortcuts that you magically knows.

Each time you enter a chamber, you somehow knows your way through test. Example: go through vents or some hidden pathways.

Give me a good explanation of how you use these 'shortcuts'?

We saw you interacting with nothing near the start at nearly all of the chambers. We thought you're hallucinating.

Hmm interesting...

It's seems my suspicions are correct... someone did breach and screw up the chamber facility.

A valuable information you just gave. I will conclude this meeting, you'll be free soon.

For that, you'll be free from this facility and cooperate for the new era of humanity.

I cannot give away that information. It's too dangerous.

If you keep asking, I will lock you up and rerun the test again.
